This post doesn\u2019t cover ev\u00adery\u00adthing rele\u00advant to the topic, but I am con\u00adfi\u00addent that ev\u00adery\u00adthing pre\u00adsented is solid.You may have no\u00adticed that plan\u00adning can be rather difficult. Granted, not all plans are difficult, plan\u00adning what you\u2019re go\u00ading to have for din\u00adner isn\u2019t too bad usu\u00adally; how\u00adever se\u00adri\u00adous plan\u00adning can range from merely daunt\u00ading to seem\u00adingly in\u00adtractable. Think of the challenge of plan\u00adning to\u00adwards a satis\u00adfy\u00ading ca\u00adreer, a fulfilling re\u00adla\u00adtion\u00adship, the suc\u00adcess of your startup, or the sim\u00adple preser\u00adva\u00adtion and flour\u00adish\u00ading of hu\u00adman civ\u00adi\u00adliza\u00adtion. I pre\u00adsent here a gears-level, re\u00adduc\u00adtion\u00adist ac\u00adcount of plan\u00adning which makes it starkly clear why plan\u00adning is hard. The point not be\u00ading that we should give up be\u00adcause plan\u00adning is fu\u00adtile. Far from it. With a de\u00adtailed model of the fac\u00adtors which make plan\u00adning hard, we can de\u00adrive a unified roadmap for how to get bet\u00adter at plan\u00adning and ul\u00adti\u00admately have a unified, pow\u00ader\u00adful ap\u00adproach to mak\u00ading bet\u00adter plans.ContentsWhat is plan\u00adning?Plan\u00adning is a pre\u00addic\u00adtion\/\u200bin\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion problemPlan\u00adning is a com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtion problemPlan\u00adning is a self-knowl\u00adedge and self-mas\u00adtery problemPlan\u00adning is a re\u00adcur\u00adsive problemSum\u00admary: what it takes to be a good plannerAp\u00adpendix: math\u00ade\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcal for\u00admal\u00adism of the com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtion problemWhat is plan\u00adning? We can\u2019t talk about why plan\u00adning is hard be\u00adfore clar\u00adify what plan\u00adning is. It\u2019s pretty sim\u00adple:Plan\u00adning is the se\u00adlec\u00adtion of ac\u00adtions in or\u00adder to achieve de\u00adsired out\u00adcomes. [1] The need for plan\u00adning arises when the fol\u00adlow\u00ading con\u00addi\u00adtions hold:There are mul\u00adti\u00adple states that the world can be in.You have prefer\u00adences over which states the world is in.There are mul\u00adti\u00adple ac\u00adtions available to you, each of which might cause the world to more likely be in some states rather than oth\u00aders.You can\u00adnot take all of the ac\u00adtions, ei\u00adther be\u00adcause you lack the re\u00adsources to do so or be\u00adcause the ac\u00adtions are in\u00adher\u00adently ex\u00adclu\u00adsive.Th\u00adese con\u00addi\u00adtions lead to a re\u00adfine\u00adment of the defi\u00adni\u00adtion above: plan\u00adning is the se\u00adlec\u00adtion of ac\u00adtions from among com\u00adpet\u00ading al\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtives. One must pri\u00adori\u00adtize among one\u2019s available op\u00adtions and al\u00adlo\u00adcate re\u00adsources to whichever op\u00adtions rank most highly. Often one is al\u00adlo\u00adcat\u00ading re\u00adsources among mul\u00adti\u00adple op\u00adtions in pro\u00adpor\u00adtion to their pri\u00ador\u00adity, but I think we can still rightly call it pri\u00adori\u00adti\u00adza\u00adtion even when one is only de\u00adcid\u00ading be\u00adtween al\u00adlo\u00adcat\u00ading 100% of their re\u00adsources to only one op\u00adtion of out two. In other words, all of plan\u00adning is pri\u00adori\u00adti\u00adza\u00adtion. [2]Plan\u00adning is a Pre\u00addic\u00adtion\/\u200bIn\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion ProblemOn what ba\u00adsis should we se\u00adlect or pri\u00adori\u00adtize one ac\u00adtion over an\u00adother? Of course, we should se\u00adlect whichever ac\u00adtions we most ex\u00adpect to lead us to the wor\u00adlds we most pre\u00adfer. We should choose ac\u00adtions based on the Ex\u00adpected Value (EV) we as\u00adsign to them.And therein lies one of the core challenges of plan\u00adning. Ex\u00adpect\u00ading is just an\u00adother word for pre\u00addict\u00ading. And pre\u00addict\u00ading is just a word which means as\u00adsign\u00ading each ac\u00adtion a prob\u00ada\u00adbil\u00adity dis\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtion over the world states it will re\u00adsult in. That\u2019s hard to do well.Plan\u00adning is hard be\u00adcause pre\u00addict\u00ading is hard. Of course, pre\u00addict\u00ading is a lot eas\u00adier when you have more in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion, but usu\u00adally we have far less than we\u2019d like, so plan\u00adning is hard be\u00adcause of limited in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion. Plan\u00adning is a pre\u00addic\u00adtion prob\u00adlem and an in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion prob\u00adlem. Peo\u00adple of think of plan\u00adning as be\u00ading about \u201cdo\u00ading\u201d, but in truth plan\u00adning is just as much about \u201cknow\u00ading\u201d. One thing this amounts to is that the in\u00adstru\u00admen\u00adtal ra\u00adtio\u00adnal\u00adity in\u00advolved in plan\u00adning is in\u00adsep\u00ada\u00adrable from the epistemic ra\u00adtio\u00adnal\u00adity of hav\u00ading true be\u00adliefs, good mod\u00adels, and mak\u00ading ac\u00adcu\u00adrate pre\u00addic\u00adtions. Any plan\u00adner\u2019s abil\u00adity is go\u00ading to be capped by their epistemic skill.What we can do with this re\u00adal\u00adiza\u00adtion is that in any situ\u00ada\u00adtion where we\u2019re plan\u00adning, we can pay de\u00adliber\u00adate at\u00adten\u00adtion to the pre\u00addic\u00adtions we need to make, the in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion we have, and ways in which might be able to make bet\u00adter pre\u00addic\u00adtions. (I call this the In\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion Con\u00adtext of a plan.) Alter\u00adna\u00adtively stated, one can be\u00adgin to ap\u00adproach plan\u00adning with an un\u00adcer\u00adtainty re\u00adduc\u00adtion mind\u00adset [3]. Rather than al\u00adlo\u00adcat\u00ading all of one\u2019s re\u00adsources from the out\u00adset, one in\u00adstead al\u00adlo\u00adcates a por\u00adtion of the re\u00adsources to\u00adwards \u201cpur\u00adchas\u00ading\u201d in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion which im\u00adproves the sub\u00adse\u00adquent al\u00adlo\u00adca\u00adtion of the rest via im\u00adproved pre\u00addic\u00adtion. We do this already in many cases (read\u00ading re\u00adviews, ask\u00ading friends, tri\u00adals), but the oc\u00adca\u00adsions where we fail to do this can cost us big time: the stu\u00addent who didn\u2019t re\u00adsearch be\u00adfore start\u00ading law school, the com\u00adpany that spent years de\u00advel\u00adop\u00ading a product be\u00adfore test\u00ading with users, the cou\u00adple who rushed into mar\u00adriage, etc. (Not the only cause, but emo\u00adtions of\u00adten make us im\u00adpa\u00adtient to go all out with an op\u00adtion with\u00adout ad\u00ade\u00adquate con\u00adsid\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion.)Un\u00adfor\u00adtu\u00adnately, while it\u2019s easy to say that get\u00adting more in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion and re\u00adduc\u00ading un\u00adcer\u00adtainty is a good thing, there\u2019s still a lot of com\u00adplex\u00adity in man\u00adag\u00ading un\u00adcer\u00adtainty. Know\u00ading how much is okay and how to effi\u00adciently re\u00adduce it. Still, always re\u00admem\u00adber\u00ading that pre\u00addic\u00adtion is a core challenge of plan\u00adning is a start.Plan\u00adning is a Com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtion ProblemUn\u00adfor\u00adtu\u00adnately, even hav\u00ading all the right in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion and perfect pre\u00addic\u00adtion would not be enough to make plan\u00adning easy. Even when one can perfectly pre\u00addict the out\u00adcome of all al\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtive op\u00adtions, plan\u00adning of\u00adten gives rise to in\u00adtractably large com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtional prob\u00adlems which are NP-Com\u00adplete. (I provide a small math\u00ade\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcal treat\u00adment in this com\u00adment be\u00adlow.)We are usu\u00adally al\u00adlo\u00adcat\u00ading a finite set of re\u00adsources (our time, our money) amount a set of op\u00adtions in or\u00adder to ac\u00adcom\u00adplish a va\u00adri\u00adety of goals. Ex\u00adam\u00adple: I might care about my health, en\u00adter\u00adtain\u00adment, ca\u00adreer, friend\u00adships, ro\u00admance, art, and ed\u00adu\u00adca\u00adtion. Towards these val\u00adues, I could in a given week: sleep, play ten\u00adnis, go to the gym, watch Net\u00adflix, work late, call up by bestie, go on Tin\u00adder, draw a pic\u00adture, read a text\u00adbook, etc. I get to al\u00adlo\u00adcate my time to some com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtion of ac\u00adtivi\u00adties, but the thing is, the num\u00adber of pos\u00adsi\u00adble com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtions for al\u00adlo\u00adcat\u00ading my time in a sin\u00adgle week is mind-bog\u00adgling. A su\u00adper-sim\u00adplified ex\u00adam\u00adple: I have 30 dis\u00adcre\u00adtionary hours in a week and 10 pos\u00adsi\u00adble ac\u00adtivi\u00adties I could spend each of those hours on, but I only spend time on ac\u00adtivi\u00adties in two-hour blocks. This re\u00adsults in 10^(30\/\u200b2) = 10^15 = one thou\u00adsand trillion differ\u00adent com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtions of how I could spend my time that week. Even if I could perfectly pre\u00addict how much I\u2019d like each com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtion of time us\u00adage, I could never con\u00adsider them all ex\u00adplic\u00aditly. This com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtional com\u00adplex\u00adity was very salient to me in my last job as a Product Man\u00adager where ev\u00adery six weeks I would choose which pro\u00adjects my team of Data Scien\u00adtists would work on. Un\u00adder ideal cir\u00adcum\u00adstances, I might get to choose ten pro\u00adjects out of a can\u00addi\u00addate twenty pro\u00adjects. Choos\u00ading was hard, es\u00adpe\u00adcially since in ad\u00addi\u00adtion to pure value of each pro\u00adject, I had to jug\u00adgle the facts that: a) pro\u00adjects were of\u00adten not in\u00adde\u00adpen\u00addent, b) pro\u00adjects of\u00adten have fu\u00adture costs, e.g. main\u00adte\u00adnance and tech debt, c) there are costs to not do\u00ading or de\u00adlay\u00ading some pro\u00adjects, d) the benefits of differ\u00adent pro\u00adjects are spread over differ\u00adent time hori\u00adzons, e) pro\u00adjects aren\u2019t com\u00admen\u00adsu\u00adrate, e.g. pro\u00adtect\u00ading down\u00adside risk vs build\u00ading new func\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adity, f) some pro\u00adjects are nec\u00ades\u00adsary to pre\u00adserve fu\u00adture op\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adity, g) bud\u00adget con\u00adstraints were soft, I could some\u00adtimes steal time from el\u00adse\u00adwhere it meant I could se\u00adlect a bet\u00adter set of pro\u00adjects.Even if I\u2019d had perfect in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion and pre\u00addic\u00adtion, which I cer\u00adtainly didn\u2019t, the num\u00adber of pos\u00adsi\u00adbil\u00adities was large enough to be in\u00adtractable by any an\u00ada\u00adlyt\u00adi\u00adcal method of pri\u00adori\u00adti\u00adza\u00adtion.I am least cer\u00adtain about how to best tackle the com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtion prob\u00adlem of plan\u00adning, but my cur\u00adrent guess is that very much re\u00adlies on effec\u00adtively us\u00ading our in\u00adstinc\u00adtive, in\u00adtu\u00aditive, Sys\u00adtem 1 think\u00ading in con\u00adjunc\u00adtion with our Sys\u00adtem 2 think\u00ading. Sys\u00adtem 1 is bet\u00adter at han\u00addling prob\u00adlems too large to be con\u00adsciously con\u00adsid\u00adered, while Sys\u00adtem 2 can en\u00adsure that Sys\u00adtem 1 is pay\u00ading at\u00adten\u00adtion to all the rele\u00advant con\u00adsid\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtions. I like cost-benefit analy\u00adses and de\u00adci\u00adsion-ma\u00adtri\u00adces not be\u00adcause I think they should make the fi\u00adnal de\u00adci\u00adsion, but be\u00adcause I think the ex\u00ader\u00adcise of cre\u00adat\u00ading them loads the right in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion into Sys\u00adtem 1.Plan\u00adning is a Self-Knowl\u00adedge & Self-Mastery ProblemIn a three-fold man\u00adner, plan\u00adning is a prob\u00adlem of self-knowl\u00adedge and self-mas\u00adtery.Pre\u00addict\u00ading yourselfThe first prob\u00adlem of plan\u00adning stated was that of pre\u00addic\u00adtion and in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion. With the ex\u00adcep\u00adtion of plans made for teams, or\u00adga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtions, coun\u00adtries, and the like, your plans will con\u00adcern your\u00adself and your ac\u00adtions. That means that in\u00advari\u00adably one of the most im\u00adpor\u00adtant things to be able to pre\u00addict is your\u00adself. Some\u00adtimes this is hard be\u00adcause we lack in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion. It might be hard to pre\u00addict how you will be\u00adhave or feel in novel cir\u00adcum\u00adstances. Other times it can be hard to pre\u00addict our\u00adselves be\u00adcause we are averse to mak\u00ading the best pos\u00adsi\u00adble pre\u00addic\u00adtions we could. We re\u00adfuse to ad\u00admit that re\u00adal\u00adis\u00adti\u00adcally we are not go\u00ading to get up at 6am to go to the gym.A par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar as\u00adpect of your\u00adself which it is key to be able to pre\u00addict is your mo\u00adti\u00adva\u00adtion. Plans which rely on un\u00adre\u00adal\u00adis\u00adtic pre\u00addic\u00adtions about how mo\u00adti\u00advated you will feel while ex\u00ade\u00adcut\u00ading the plans are prob\u00ada\u00adbly go\u00ading to be un\u00adsuc\u00adcess\u00adful plans.Ad\u00advice I have for this as\u00adpect of plan\u00adning is a) start pay\u00ading at\u00adten\u00adtion to your\u00adself and to pre\u00addict\u00ading your\u00adself, for\u00adtu\u00adnately usu\u00adally you have a lot of data to work with, b) adopt a policy of rad\u00adi\u00adcal-self hon\u00adesty, what is true is already so and good pre\u00addic\u00adtions are the ba\u00adsis of good plans.Know\u00ading what you wantThis post started with the defi\u00adni\u00adtion that plan\u00adning is the se\u00adlec\u00adtion of ac\u00adtions to\u00adwards de\u00adsired out\u00adcomes. It is rather im\u00adpor\u00adtant that you cor\u00adrectly iden\u00adtify your ac\u00adtual de\u00adsired out\u00adcomes, oth\u00ader\u00adwise, any ac\u00adtions you se\u00adlect aren\u2019t likely to be worth much. \u201cI thought I wanted X ac\u00adtu\u00adally but I didn\u2019t\u201d is too of\u00adten the foil of a sup\u00adpos\u00adedly suc\u00adcess\u00adful plan where the plan\u00adner ev\u00adi\u00addently lacked good self-pre\u00addic\u00adtion.I\u2019m of the be\u00adlief that one\u2019s deep-down de\u00adsired out\u00adcomes (per\u00adsonal and moral) are con\u00adtained in\u00adside one\u2019s brain, re\u00adgard\u00adless of whether one has achieved good con\u00adscious ac\u00adcess to them or in\u00adferred all the con\u00adse\u00adquences of them. Much of good plan\u00adning is re\u00adduc\u00ading un\u00adcer\u00adtainty around what is that you ac\u00adtu\u00adally want and value. Self-pre\u00addic\u00adtion is a spe\u00adcial case of the gen\u00aderal pre\u00addic\u00adtion\/\u200bin\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion prob\u00adlem, but it re\u00adquires differ\u00adent tech\u00adniques of un\u00adcer\u00adtainty re\u00adduc\u00adtion than out\u00adside-world pre\u00addic\u00adtion does. In\u00adtro\u00adspec\u00adtive meth\u00adods such as med\u00adi\u00adta\u00adtion, Fo\u00adcus\u00ading, In\u00adter\u00adnal Fam\u00adily Sys\u00adtems, etc. are helpful for hav\u00ading bet\u00adter knowl\u00adedge of which out\u00adcomes you ac\u00adtu\u00adally want.Of course, com\u00adpli\u00adcat\u00ading the dis\u00adcov\u00adery of what your de\u00adsired out\u00adcomes are is that the no\u00adtion of you may be a lit\u00adtle com\u00adpli\u00adcated. I have been per\u00adsuaded over the years that it can be very use\u00adful to think of your\u00adself as be\u00ading made up of parts or sub-agents, each with their own par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar de\u00adsires. Mas\u00adter\u00ading your\u00adself means com\u00ading to un\u00adder\u00adstand your parts and their de\u00adsires lead\u00ading into an abil\u00adity to make plans that satisfy all your\u00adself. This can be cru\u00adcial as mak\u00ading plans which parts of you are not on\u00adboard of\u00adten causes those parts to un\u00adder\u00admine the plan.Re\u00adlat\u00adedly, \u201cmak\u00ading your\u00adself do some\u00adthing\u201d should always be a warn\u00ading sign that some part of you is be\u00ading dis\u00adre\u00adgarded. Some\u00adtimes that\u2019s le\u00adgi\u00adt\u00adi\u00admate, but re\u00adally only if you\u2019re ac\u00adcount\u00ading for it in your self-pre\u00addic\u00adtions and how it\u2019s go\u00ading to af\u00adfect over\u00adall suc\u00adcess. Self-mas\u00adtery of your hu\u00adman brainHu\u00adman brains are re\u00adally, re\u00adally good, but they\u2019re also re\u00adally com\u00adpli\u00adcated with a lot of differ\u00adent mov\u00ading pieces and no user man\u00adual. Most of us man\u00adage, but there are gains to be had from bet\u00adter at op\u00ader\u00adat\u00ading our own minds.Heuris\u00adtics and biasesTo get bet\u00adter at pre\u00addict\u00ading, it helps to un\u00adder\u00adstand when our brains na\u00adtively do and don\u2019t make good pre\u00addic\u00adtions of their own ac\u00adcord. That leads di\u00adrectly into heuris\u00adtics and bi\u00adases and at\u00adtempts to be\u00adcome a lens which sees its flaws.Us\u00ading Sys\u00adtem 1 (in\u00adtu\u00adition) and Sys\u00adtem 2 (ex\u00adplicit rea\u00adson) in harmonyHu\u00adman brains run on both and each sys\u00adtem has its ad\u00advan\u00adtages and dis\u00adad\u00advan\u00adtages. The hu\u00adman who is lev\u00ader\u00adag\u00ading their brain to its ful\u00adlest ex\u00adtent is us\u00ading all of their mind in har\u00admony, not priv\u00adileg\u00ading or dis\u00adre\u00adgard\u00ading one kind of think\u00ading in\u00adap\u00adpro\u00adpri\u00adately. This hard though, but re\u00adally a key part of get\u00adting good at plan\u00adning. Emo\u00adtional MasteryAr\u00adguably emo\u00adtions could be lumped un\u00adder Sys\u00adtem 1, but it\u2019s worth call\u00ading them out sep\u00ada\u00adrately. While emo\u00adtions serve mul\u00adti\u00adple pur\u00adposes, one of the things they do is carry an im\u00adpor\u00adtant sig\u00adnal of in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion from your sub\u00adcon\u00adscious mind. If you feel anx\u00adious about some\u00adthing or hav\u00ading a nig\u00adgling doubt or what\u00adever, that\u2019s be\u00adcause there\u2019s a part of your mind has been pro\u00adcess\u00ading raw data and find\u00ading it sig\u00adnifi\u00adcant. The skil\u00adled plan\u00adner and pre\u00addic\u00adtor will be some\u00adone who can ex\u00adtract that valuable in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion from their emo\u00adtions.How\u00adever, emo\u00adtional mas\u00adtery is per\u00adhaps even more im\u00adpor\u00adtant to plan\u00adning in an\u00adother way. Many, many plans are bad plans be\u00adcause peo\u00adple lapse into op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for their emo\u00adtions rather than ac\u00adtual long-term de\u00adsired out\u00adcomes. A per\u00adson who rushes into a plan with in\u00adad\u00ade\u00adquate in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion be\u00adcause they dis\u00adlike be\u00ading in a state of in\u00adde\u00adci\u00adsion is likely choos\u00ading a worse plan be\u00adcause they were un\u00adable to han\u00addle their un\u00adpleas\u00adant emo\u00adtions. Or a per\u00adson who only ex\u00ade\u00adcutes ex\u00adtremely con\u00adser\u00adva\u00adtive plans be\u00adcause any\u00adthing bold makes them too feel anx\u00adious. I be\u00adlieve schools of thought which help with emo\u00adtional mas\u00adtery such as ACT, CBT, and DBT have a place among the train\u00ading ma\u00adte\u00adri\u00adals for great plan\u00adners.Plan\u00adning is a Re\u00adcur\u00adsive ProblemWe\u2019ve cov\u00adered that plan\u00adning re\u00adquires iden\u00adti\u00adfy\u00ading your op\u00adtions, pre\u00addict\u00ading their out\u00adcomes, eval\u00adu\u00adat\u00ading the good\u00adness of said out\u00adcomes, and then some\u00adhow crunch\u00ading through all the differ\u00adent com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtions of pos\u00adsi\u00adble ac\u00adtions to se\u00adlect the best over\u00adall set. Ex\u00adcept plan\u00adning is re\u00adcur\u00adsive. Any difficult plan is go\u00ading to be com\u00adposed of mul\u00adti\u00adple sub-plans and for each one of those sub-plans the whole pro\u00adcess needs to re\u00adpeated again: iden\u00adti\u00adfy\u00ading op\u00adtions, mak\u00ading pre\u00addic\u00adtions, se\u00adlect\u00ading com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtions, etc.First, this adds to the already ex\u00adten\u00adsive amount of com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtion in\u00advolved in plan\u00adning. Se\u00adcond, it can of\u00adten cause plans to span mul\u00adti\u00adple do\u00admains strain\u00ading all but the most ver\u00adsa\u00adtile gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adists. Have pity for the as\u00adpiring baker whose plan was to make the best muffins in town, but now has to figure out dou\u00adble-en\u00adtry ac\u00adcount\u00ading and US tax code. Or the physi\u00adcist-cum-founder who wanted to cre\u00adate clean en\u00adergy tech\u00adnolo\u00adgies but now needs to figure out a sales and mar\u00adket\u00ading strat\u00adegy too.At a base level, the challenges of good plan\u00adning re\u00admain con\u00adstant be\u00adtween do\u00admains, e.g. mak\u00ading good pre\u00addic\u00adtions, as well the ad\u00advis\u00adable steps, e.g. re\u00adduc\u00ading un\u00adcer\u00adtainty. Yet the con\u00adcrete steps for do\u00ading these might look very differ\u00adent. The physi\u00adcist-founder might have been very good at re\u00adduc\u00ading un\u00adcer\u00adtainty in the lab\u00ado\u00adra\u00adtory with ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adments, but the feed\u00adback loop for iter\u00adat\u00ading on sales strat\u00adegy might be com\u00adpletely differ\u00adent, even if in both cases you\u2019re try\u00ading to re\u00adduce un\u00adcer\u00adtainty.Shift\u00ading be\u00adtween do\u00admains is prob\u00ada\u00adbly a rea\u00adson why peo\u00adple who are good at re\u00adduc\u00ading un\u00adcer\u00adtainty and plan\u00adning in some do\u00admains are neg\u00adli\u00adgent in oth\u00aders. Ar\u00adguably, the skil\u00adled plan\u00adner is go\u00ading to figure out the right spe\u00adcific tech\u00adniques to achieve good plans across all the do\u00admains they touch. In some do\u00admains, you might have lots of ex\u00adperts you can poll; in oth\u00aders it might be cheap to run ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adments; in some you can build good ex\u00adplicit mod\u00adels; in oth\u00aders it\u2019s all about train\u00ading in\u00adtu\u00adition; and yet in fur\u00adther cases it might not be easy at all and you\u2019re left try\u00ading to draw ten\u00adu\u00adous in\u00adfer\u00adences from his\u00adtor\u00adi\u00adcal ex\u00adam\u00adple.Sum\u00admary: What It Takes to Be a Great PlannerWe can neatly sum\u00adma\u00adrize why plan\u00adning can be so difficult with a list of all the traits one should have in or\u00adder to over\u00adcome the difficul\u00adties.One must be ex\u00adcel\u00adlent at mak\u00ading pre\u00addic\u00adtions across do\u00admains, helped by their mas\u00adtery of epistemic skill and virtue.One must be skil\u00adled at iden\u00adti\u00adfy\u00ading which in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion one needs yet lacks and at ex\u00ade\u00adcut\u00ading sub-plans to effi\u00adciently ob\u00adtain this in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion across differ\u00adent do\u00admains and the dis\u00adparate tech\u00adniques re\u00adquired to do so.One must be skil\u00adled at mak\u00ading choices within com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adto\u00adri\u00adally ex\u00adplo\u00adsive prob\u00adlems in\u00advolv\u00ading the se\u00adlec\u00adtion of com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtions of mul\u00adti\u00adple op\u00adtions to\u00adwards mul\u00adti\u00adple goals via the use of heuris\u00adtics, ex\u00adcel\u00adlent in\u00adtu\u00adition\/\u200bin\u00adstinct, or some other re\u00adli\u00adable method.One must be able to make use of their Sys\u00adtem 1 and Sys\u00adtem 2 to think in har\u00admony.One must have knowl\u00adedge of their true val\u00adues, goals, and de\u00adsired states of the world.One must have knowl\u00adedge of their sub-parts and al\u00adign\u00adment be\u00adtween them so that one does not un\u00adder\u00admine one\u00adself.One must be able to pre\u00addict one\u2019s own be\u00adhav\u00adior in\u00adclud\u00ading the be\u00adhav\u00adior of one\u2019s mo\u00adti\u00adva\u00adtions and emo\u00adtions so that one can plan effec\u00adtively around them.One must be able to re\u00adduce un\u00adcer\u00adtainty about one\u2019s self-model via ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adments or in\u00adtro\u00adspec\u00adtive tools.One must be able to listen to the in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion con\u00adtained in their emo\u00adtions.One must not let their emo\u00adtions co\u00aderce them into plans which sate their emo\u00adtions while sac\u00adri\u00adfic\u00ading their over\u00adall goals.One must be able to plan effec\u00adtively up and down the re\u00adcur\u00adsive tree of their plans: enu\u00admer\u00adat\u00ading, eval\u00adu\u00adat\u00ading, and re\u00adduc\u00ading un\u00adcer\u00adtainty wher\u00adever needed.Endnotes[1] This broad defi\u00adni\u00adtion stands in op\u00adpo\u00adsi\u00adtion to a com\u00admon defi\u00adni\u00adtion which uses plan\u00adning pri\u00admar\u00adily in con\u00adtexts of schedul\u00ading, e.g. plan your day, plan your week. The broader defi\u00adni\u00adtion here is es\u00adsen\u00adtially syn\u00adony\u00admous with de\u00adci\u00adsion-mak\u00ading, per\u00adhaps differ\u00ading only in con\u00adno\u00adta\u00adtion.

The term plan\u00adning also some\u00adwhat more than de\u00adci\u00adsion-mak\u00ading high\u00adlights that there is a goal one wishes to achieve.[2] I of\u00adten hear peo\u00adple faced with clear pri\u00adori\u00adti\u00adza\u00adtion tasks plead that they need more re\u00adsource, that re\u00adsource scarcity is the prob\u00adlem. Some\u00adtimes it is, some\u00adtimes the best ac\u00adtion is to get more re\u00adsources. But of\u00adten it is a fal\u00adlacy to think that if you can\u2019t solve pri\u00adori\u00adti\u00adza\u00adtion now, it will some\u00adhow be eas\u00adier when you have more re\u00adsources. How\u00adever many re\u00adsources you have, they will be finite and you will still be able to think of things you\u2019d like to do with even more re\u00adsources, things which feel just as nec\u00ades\u00adsary. In short, you should get used to choos\u00ading sooner rather than later.

As\u00adsume there are m po\u00adten\u00adtial pro\u00adjects. For now, as\u00adsume that the pro\u00adjects are in\u00adde\u00adpen\u00addent; that is, it is rea\u00adson\u00adable to se\u00adlect any com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtion of pro\u00adjects and the cost and value of any pro\u00adject do not de\u00adpend on what other pro\u00adjects are se\u00adlected. Define, for each pro\u00adject i = 1, 2,..., m the zero-one vari\u00adable xi. The vari\u00adable xi is one if the pro\u00adject is ac\u00adcepted and zero if it is re\u00adjected. Let ci be the in\u00adcre\u00admen\u00adtal value (b for \u201cbenefit\u201d) of the i\u2019th pro\u00adject and ci be its cost. Let C be the to\u00adtal available bud\u00adget. The goal is to se\u00adlect from the available pro\u00adjects the sub\u00adset of pro\u00adjects with a to\u00adtal cost less than or equal to C that pro\u00adduces the great\u00adest pos\u00adsi\u00adble to\u00adtal value.The prob\u00adlem may be ex\u00adpressed math\u00ade\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcally as:Max\u00adi\u00admize m\u2211i=1bixiSub\u00adject to: m\u2211i=1cixi\u2264C and xi= 0 or 1 for i = 1, 2,...,m.This is a zero-one in\u00adte\u00adger op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion prob\u00adlem. It is NP-Com\u00adplete, i.e. the time re\u00adquired to solve such a prob\u00adlem us\u00ading any cur\u00adrently known al\u00adgorithm in\u00adcreases rapidly as the size of the pro\u00adgram grows. Nat\u00adu\u00adrally, be\u00adcause al\u00adlo\u00adcat\u00ading re\u00adsources\/\u200bplan\u00adning is in\u00advolves com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtions of ac\u00adtions and com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adtions tend to ex\u00adplode. It can be okay if there the num\u00adber of pos\u00adsi\u00adble ac\u00adtions\/\u200bpro\u00adjects is rel\u00ada\u00adtively small, but re\u00admem\u00adber that even 10! is already 3.6 mil\u00adlion. The equa\u00adtion above isn\u2019t com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsive enough to cap\u00adture the full de\u00adtail of real-world plan\u00adning, but it should suffice to in\u00addi\u00adcate that plan\u00adning is of\u00adten of the com\u00adbi\u00adna\u00adto\u00adri\u00adally ex\u00adplo\u00adsive class. (If you want to see how more fac\u00adtors can be in\u00adcluded, see the rest of Merkhofer\u2019s pa\u00adper where he mod\u00adels mu\u00adtu\u00adally ex\u00adclu\u00adsive\/\u200bse\u00adquen\u00adtial pro\u00adjects, multi-pe\u00adriod plan\u00adning, and sen\u00adsi\u00adtivity to de\u00adlay of pro\u00adjects.)Note how\u00adever that this treat\u00adment as\u00adsumes that the benefits and costs are perfectly known when perform\u00ading the op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion. In the real world, we only have dis\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtions over the benefits and costs. A true for\u00admal\u00adism of real-world pri\u00adori\u00adti\u00adza\u00adtion would be couched in statis\u00adti\u00adcal terms. Plus, the benefits and costs in the above for\u00admal\u00adism are scalars which can be added and com\u00adpared, e.g. dol\u00adlars. In the real world, the benefits and costs we weigh are of dis\u00adparate types which at best have vague con\u00adver\u00adsion rates be\u00adtween them. So you might imag\u00adine that a com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsive for\u00admal\u00adism would deal in vec\u00adtors and would in\u00adclude a com\u00adpli\u00adcated func\u00adtion for com\u00adpar\u00ading those vec\u00adtors.The point here is not that we should at\u00adtempt to cre\u00adate or use math\u00ade\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcal mod\u00adels in our plan\u00adning, but to rec\u00adog\u00adnize that it is pre\u00adcisely this math which our brains must find some way of crunch\u00ading. Un\u00adder\u00adstand\u00ading that this is the im\u00admense prob\u00adlem we are tasked with, we can start to look for ways to han\u00addle it bet\u00adter than our de\u00adfault.

Now, maybe\nthere's some magic technique for picking out the information that\nmatters, passing over the rest, and writing out a single, coherent\nstory in one pass through all the papers you can find. If that\ntechnique exists, I have no idea what it is.\nSo when every paper brings up ten new questions and twenty papers to\nstart answering them, I need a system to keep my notes organized. I\nneed notes that let me jump back and forth between papers without\nlosing my place, draw links between papers, and store lists of\ncitations to come back to. Here's how I do it.\n\nStoring papers with Zotero\nThe first tool I use is Zotero, a reference\nmanager. Zotero's job is to store all the actual papers I come across,\nalong with information like data on how to cite the papers and any\ntags they might have been published with. It can grab that information\nfrom my web browser, whether from a journal's website or someplace\nlike Google Scholar or PubMed. It's also great for quickly putting\ntogether a bibliography, using bibtex or similar programs, when I want\nto write up some results.\n\n\n\nZotero stores the papers I want to\nread and reference. I scaled up the font size here to make it readable\nin a tiny blog image.\nZotero isn't the only choice for reference managers.\nMendeley is another popular choice, and\nthere are a\nwhole bunch more\nout there. I picked Zotero arbitrarily a few years ago, but it's\nworking out well because of its emacs integration.\nKeeping notes with Emacs and Org mode\nYou see, Zotero has some note-taking functions, and I used to keep my\nnotes there, but there were some problems. Notes are stored as\nseparate files for each paper, but I want to cross-reference notes\nfrom a lot of different papers at once. And while the editor has some\nrich-text capabilities (e.g. bold and italic text), it's missing\nimportant things I need in my notes, like the ability to typeset\nequations.\nThat's where Emacs and its\nextension Org mode come in. To borrow a term\nfrom Perl enthusiasts, Org mode is the swiss army chainsaw of text\ndocument formats. Org mode documents have a lot of features, and it's\nway beyond this post's scope to describe them all. For the purpose of\nresearch notes, the most useful things it lets me do are:\n\nI can store my notes in a hierarchical tree structure, and I can\n  hide parts of the tree from view in order to focus on other parts.\nI can put hyperlinks into my notes, including links to papers,\n  websites, or other parts of the file.\nI can put math in my notes using Latex, and view the typeset\n  equations right in my Emacs buffer.\n\n\n\n\nA sample from my notes file. You\ncan see the tree structure of the file, some links to papers, and a\nlittle bit of inline math, using Latex.\nGluing it all together with zotxt\nNow, see those links to papers in my notes buffer? I didn't have to\ncopy and paste them from anywhere. I inserted them with just three\nkeystrokes each. So far, I've just described some useful pieces of\nsoftware, but the interesting part of my workflow is how they fit\ntogether.\nzotxt is an extension that lets\nother programs talk to Zotero, and Emacs has a package to talk to it.\nIt's even structured specifically to work with Org mode documents.\nWith zotxt, my workflow looks like this:\n\nI find a paper I want to look at somewhere on the internet.\nI use Zotero's browser plugin to save it to Zotero. Hopefully it\n  grabs the paper itself and this happens in one click; if the site\n  doesn't play along, I spend a minute grabbing a pdf and feeding it\n  to Zotero.\nI insert a link to the Zotero entry into my notes file in Emacs. I\n  can do this with the key chords C-c \" \". I don't need to further\n  specify what paper I want to grab: the browser plugin leaves the\n  paper selected in Zotero, and zotxt can grab the selected paper.\nWhen I want to read the paper, I go to the link and tell Emacs to\n  open the paper in my system PDF viewer. The key chords for this are\n  C-c \" a, and then selecting the PDF attachment from the Helm\n  window that appears (usually I just type pdf RET).\nWhen I'm reading a paper and see a citation that might be useful, I\n  look it up on the internet and repeat this process to store a note\n  linking to it.\n\nIt took me a while to get it set up to my liking, so here's how I did\nit:\n\nFirst, install zotxt. If you're\n  using Zotero as a firefox extension, you just need to install zotxt\n  as another extension. If you're using the standalone Zotero client,\n  you can still do it: download the extension file from that link,\n  then go to the Add-Ons Manager under the Tools menu and find the\n  option to install an add-on from a file.\n\n\n\n\nThe menu option looks like\nthis.\n\nNext, install the zotxt package in emacs. If your\n  package manager is set up, you\n  can just type M-x package-install RET zotxt RET.\nNow, when org-zotxt-mode is active, you can use its functions in\n  your org-mode buffers. You can search for papers and insert them\n  with C-c \" i, insert the currently-selected paper in Zotero with\n  C-u C-c \" i, and open a paper's PDF or other related files by\n  moving the cursor to a link and typing C-c \" a. However, you might\n  want a little bit more setup to deal with some annoyances.\nYou probably want to have org-zotxt-mode automatically activated\n  in all your org-mode documents. To make that happen, you can add\n  some code to your .emacs file to start up this mode on all your\n  org-mode buffers - see below this list for the .emacs\n  configuration I use.\nIf you want to insert a link to the currently-selected item a lot,\n  C-u C-c \" i is an awkward sequence to type. I rebound it to C-c \"\n  \".\nYou might notice that when you insert a link to a paper, the text of\n  that link is a full citation. That might be what you want, but I\n  just want the authors, paper name, and year. It took me a bit of\n  hacking to get around that: it's possible to tell the emacs zotxt\n  interface to use a different citation format than the default, but I\n  had to throw together a little XML file to give it a shorter format\n  than a full citation. (This may not be the easiest or cleanest way\n  to do it, but it works!)\n  That XML file is here. To use it, go into\n  your Zotero preferences and select Cite -> Styles, and add the file.\n  It should appear in the menu as \"mkbehr's short reference format\".\n  Then add the last two lines in the .emacs snippet below, and you\n  should get shorter citations.\nYou probably want to install the\n  Helm package, to make zotxt's\n  search interface easier to navigate. That link should tell you\n  everything you need to know.\n\nHere's that .emacs setup code:\n;; Activate org-zotxt-mode in org-mode buffers\n(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-zotxt-mode 1)))\n;; Bind something to replace the awkward C-u C-c \" i\n(define-key org-mode-map\n  (kbd \"C-c \\\" \\\"\") (lambda () (interactive)\n                      (org-zotxt-insert-reference-link '(4))))\n;; Change citation format to be less cumbersome in files.\n;; You'll need to install mkbehr-short into your style manager first.\n(eval-after-load \"zotxt\"\n'(setq zotxt-default-bibliography-style \"mkbehr-short\"))\n\nOf course, I'm not done tinkering to make my workflow better. I hear\ngood things about the org-ref\nand helm-bibtex\npackages - if only I can keep an up-to-date bibtex file as I add papers\nto my library, I can associate links with not only a paper's pdf, but\nalso that paper's section of my notes file. And I haven't found a\nsmooth way to take a paper and pull up the papers it cites in my\nbrowser. But until then, I'm pretty happy with this setup.\nHappy researching!\n\n\n\nemacs\nresearch\n\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\nNext post\n\nComments\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nComments powered by Disqus\n\n\n\n\n            Contents \u00a9 2015         Michael Behr - Powered by         Nikola\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"chosen":"  Synchronous and Asynchronous Data Transmission | Computer Science                                            Skip to content      Menu  Home Membership Sign up Contact  About   Login           Teach Computer Science         Menu  KS3 Resources  KS3 Theory Topics KS3 Algorithms Topics KS3 Programming KS3 Networking KS3 Data Representation KS3 Connecting clients & server KS3 Databases Resources All KS3   GCSE Resources  GCSE Python Course  Resources  Python Basic Output Tutorial Python Variables Tutorial Python Basic Input Tutorial Python Calculations Tutorial Python Control Flow Tutorial Python Readability Tutorial Python Loops (For) Tutorial Python Lists Tutorial Python Functions Tutorial Python While Loops Tutorial Python Strings Tutorial Python Files Handling Tutorial     Theory Topics Computer Architecture Computer Hardware Data Representation Memory and Data Storage Networking Computer Security and Ethics Algorithms Programming Databases All GCSE   A-Level Resources  A Level Python Course A Level Contemporary Processes A Level Software & Development A Level Exchanging Data A Level Data Types & Structures A Level Legal & Moral Issues A Level Computational Thinking A Level Problem Solving  All A-Level    Exam Board Mapping  GCSE  AQA CIE 2020 CIE 2022-24 (0984) CIE 0478 Edexcel IGCSE Edexcel OCR Eduqas WJEC National 5   A Level  AQA CIE 2022 (9618) OCR IB Computing Eduqas WJEC SQA Higher Level SQA Advanced Higher     Revision  Past Papers Mock Exams Data Representation Data Storage Databases Ethics Hardware & Software Internet Networks Programming Security         Synchronous and Asynchronous Data Transmission        KS3 Computer Science 11-14 Years Old 48 modules covering EVERY Computer Science topic needed for KS3 level.

Synchronous transmission is effective, dependable, and often utilised for transmitting a large amount of data.\u00a0 It offers real-time communication between linked devices. An example of synchronous transmission would be the transfer of a large text file.\u00a0 Before the file is transmitted, it is first dissected into blocks of sentences.\u00a0 The blocks are then transferred over the communication link to the target location. Because there are no beginning and end bits, the data transfer rate is quicker but there\u2019s an increased possibility of errors occurring.\u00a0 Over time, the clocks will get out of sync, and the target device would have the incorrect time, so some bytes could become damaged on account of lost bits.\u00a0 To resolve this issue, it\u2019s necessary to regularly re-synchronise the clocks, as well as to make use of check digits to ensure that the bytes are correctly received and translated.  Characteristics of Synchronous Transmission There are no spaces in between characters being sent.Timing is provided by modems or other devices at the end of the transmission.Special\u00a0\u2019syn\u2019\u00a0characters goes before the data being sent.The\u00a0syn\u00a0characters are included between chunks of data for timing functions. Examples of Synchronous Transmission ChatroomsVideo conferencingTelephonic conversationsFace-to-face interactions Asynchronous Transmission In asynchronous transmission, data moves in a half-paired approach, 1 byte or 1 character at a time.\u00a0 It sends the data in a constant current of bytes.\u00a0 The size of a character transmitted is 8 bits, with a parity bit added both at the beginning and at the end, making it a total of 10 bits.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t need a clock for integration\u2014rather, it utilises the parity bits to tell the receiver how to translate the data. It is straightforward, quick, cost-effective, and doesn\u2019t need 2-way communication to function. Characteristics of Asynchronous Transmission Each character is headed by a beginning bit and concluded with one or more end bits.There may be gaps or spaces in between characters.

There are some \u201cnat\u00adu\u00adral\u201d choices\u2014places and times which stand out, like the top of the Em\u00adpire State Build\u00ading at noon. Th\u00adese are called Schel\u00adling points.More gen\u00ader\u00adally, Schel\u00adling points are rele\u00advant when\u00adever two or more peo\u00adple need to make \u201cmatch\u00ading\u201d choices with limited abil\u00adity to com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adcate in ad\u00advance.

Some air\u00adports ac\u00adtu\u00adally do this:Ebay and Uber are of course also ex\u00adam\u00adples of pur\u00adpose-built Schel\u00adling points.One in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading fea\u00adture of cre\u00adat\u00ading a Schel\u00adling point is that we may have some de\u00adgrees of free\u00addom available, and we can use those de\u00adgrees of free\u00addom to ex\u00adtract value.In our meetup ex\u00adam\u00adple, we could imag\u00adine putting the meetup point in\u00adside a build\u00ading, and charg\u00ading peo\u00adple to get in\u2014much like Ebay or Uber charge fees for their ser\u00advices. Or, we could imag\u00adine lo\u00adcal busi\u00adnesses want\u00ading to put the meetup point nearby, in hopes of at\u00adtract\u00ading busi\u00adness from meeters\u2014one could imag\u00adine a gimicky air\u00adport restau\u00adrant with a bunch of \u201cMEET HERE!\u201d signs hop\u00ading to sell peo\u00adple over\u00adpriced na\u00adchos and drinks while they wait to meet up with friends or fam\u00adily. Alter\u00adna\u00adtively, we could imag\u00adine users of the meetup point want\u00ading it in lo\u00adca\u00adtions con\u00adve\u00adnient to them\u2014e.g. in the New York City ex\u00adam\u00adple, peo\u00adple in a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar neigh\u00adbor\u00adhood might cam\u00adpaign to es\u00adtab\u00adlish the meetup point there for their own con\u00adve\u00adnience.How\u00adever, the Schel\u00adling point cre\u00adator\/\u200bcon\u00adtrol\u00adler only has so many de\u00adgrees of free\u00addom. Charge too high a fee, and peo\u00adple will go to some other Schel\u00adling point. Move the meetup point to a neigh\u00adbor\u00adhood in the out\u00adskirts of town, and it will be too in\u00adcon\u00adve\u00adnient for peo\u00adple from other neigh\u00adbor\u00adhoods. By de\u00adfault, peo\u00adple will usu\u00adally stick to Schel\u00adling points which ev\u00adery\u00adone is already us\u00ading\u2014if ev\u00adery\u00adbody has always met up un\u00adder this par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar sign, then that\u2019s the ob\u00advi\u00adous place to keep meet\u00ading up\u2014so the con\u00adtrol\u00adler of the origi\u00adnal Schel\u00adling point can ex\u00adtract more value than \u201cnew\u201d points. But there are always limits.We can think of a Schel\u00adling-point-con\u00adtrol\u00adler\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d as their range of free\u00addom in mov\u00ading the point around, or as the amount of value they can ex\u00adtract with\u00adout los\u00ading out to some other Schel\u00adling point. Just be\u00adcause some\u00adone nom\u00adi\u00adnally \u201ccon\u00adtrols\u201d the Schel\u00adling point does not mean they can ac\u00adtu\u00adally do any\u00adthing with\u00adout los\u00ading it! It may be that even a small fee will drive ev\u00adery\u00adone to switch to a differ\u00adent Schel\u00adling point. It may be that the Schel\u00adling point is in the dead cen\u00adter of the city and peo\u00adple will keep meet\u00ading in the dead cen\u00adter even if the signs move (e.g. maybe some\u00adone will just put up new signs for the \u201ccity cen\u00adter\u201d and peo\u00adple will meet there). It may be that main\u00adtain\u00ading all the signs costs roughly as much as one can earn from the Schel\u00adling point (oth\u00ader\u00adwise a com\u00adpeti\u00adtor would come along and put up more signs of their own). There are many ways to ex\u00adtract value from a Schel\u00adling point, but if there\u2019s some mechanism for open com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion over con\u00adtrol of the point, then the net value one can ex\u00adtract may be driven to near-zero.That\u2019s roughly how I think poli\u00adtics works.Gover\u00adnance as Schel\u00adling PointWhen peo\u00adple are op\u00ader\u00adat\u00ading in a group, it\u2019s use\u00adful to have stan\u00addard\u00adized Schel\u00adling points for a wide va\u00adri\u00adety of in\u00adter\u00adper\u00adsonal con\u00adflicts, so that we don\u2019t need a bunch of ex\u00adpen\u00adsive ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00ada\u00adtion\/\u200bcon\u00adflict to re\u00adsolve each one. Th\u00adese Schel\u00adling points are things like \u201crules\u201d and \u201clead\u00aders\u201d.An ex\u00adam\u00adple: Alice likes to rock out to loud mu\u00adsic af\u00adter sun\u00addown, while her neigh\u00adbor Bob likes to go to bed early. They have con\u00adflict\u00ading prefer\u00adences for when quiet hours should be. But nei\u00adther of them wants to get in a fight about it, or spend a bunch of time and effort ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adat\u00ading. So, the build\u00ading\/\u200bneigh\u00adbor\u00adhood has a rule: \u201cquiet hours run from 10pm to 6am\u201d. The main pur\u00adpose of the rule is to act as a Schel\u00adling point: by de\u00adfault, those are the quiet hours which ev\u00adery\u00adone re\u00adspects and ex\u00adpects ev\u00adery\u00adone else to re\u00adspect. They might be en\u00adforced if needed, but usu\u00adally that doesn\u2019t ac\u00adtu\u00adally hap\u00adpen. Of course, Alice and Bob could still work out a sep\u00ada\u00adrate deal\u2014e.g. maybe Alice talks to all her neigh\u00adbors and gets their ok to play loud mu\u00adsic on Fri\u00adday night\u2014but that would re\u00adquire a bunch of ex\u00adtra ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00ada\u00adtion. The offi\u00adcial rule is the Schel\u00adling point ev\u00adery\u00adbody co\u00ador\u00addi\u00adnates on, by de\u00adfault.More gen\u00ader\u00adally, laws and courts serve as Schel\u00adling points in ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00ada\u00adtions. Where does my prop\u00aderty end and yours be\u00adgin? The gov\u00adern\u00adment land records provide a Schel\u00adling point an\u00adswer, so we don\u2019t need to fight\/\u200bne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adate over it our\u00adselves. In a dis\u00adagree\u00adment over land, the po\u00adlice and mil\u00adi\u00adtary all want to co\u00ador\u00addi\u00adnate and back the same per\u00adson, so the gov\u00adern\u00adment\u2019s land records tell them all who the \u201cright\u00adful\u201d owner is. Since the po\u00adlice and mil\u00adi\u00adtary co\u00ador\u00addi\u00adnate around that Schel\u00adling point, it be\u00adcomes the nat\u00adu\u00adral Schel\u00adling point for oth\u00aders as well.In prin\u00adci\u00adple, the legally-rec\u00adog\u00adnized Schel\u00adling point could sim\u00adply be ig\u00adnored\u2014e.g. if a chunk of land is legally rec\u00adog\u00adnized as your prop\u00aderty, and I build some\u00adthing on it with\u00adout per\u00admis\u00adsion, the two of us could just agree that this is fine, effec\u00adtively ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adat\u00ading a differ\u00adent Schel\u00adling point. Some non-gov\u00adern\u00adment group could even have mechanisms to en\u00adforce the al\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtive Schel\u00adling point. But the le\u00adgal Schel\u00adling point is the one which po\u00adlice and the mil\u00adi\u00adtary are will\u00ading to en\u00adforce.Poli\u00adti\u00adcal PowerThe Death Eaters don\u2019t always agree on when, where or how to launch an at\u00adtack, but they know that any at\u00adtack will go bet\u00adter if they\u2019re all in it to\u00adgether. So, they band to\u00adgether be\u00adhind a leader, and at\u00adtack when, where and how the leader di\u00adrects. The leader\u2019s or\u00adders be\u00adcome the Schel\u00adling point ac\u00adtion for the group.The Death Eaters ex\u00adam\u00adple illus\u00adtrates the no\u00adtion of \u201cpoli\u00adti\u00adcal power\u201d par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly well: the leader\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d is roughly the set of or\u00adders he could give with\u00adout his or\u00adders ceas\u00ading to be a Schel\u00adling point for group ac\u00adtivity. If the Death Eaters are mostly in agree\u00adment on some course of ac\u00adtion, and the leader di\u00adrects against it, then his or\u00adders be\u00adcome less of a Schel\u00adling point, and mul\u00adti\u00adple such or\u00adders will likely see him re\u00admoved from nom\u00adi\u00adnal power. He has some de\u00adgree of free\u00addom in which or\u00adders to give, but only to the ex\u00adtent that the Death eaters are, on av\u00ader\u00adage, mostly in agree\u00adment with his choices.There\u2019s a gen\u00aderal prin\u00adci\u00adple of \u201cpower\u201d here: a leader\u2019s power is the set of or\u00adders they could give with\u00adout their or\u00adders ceas\u00ading to be Schel\u00adling points for the group\u2019s ac\u00adtivi\u00adties. A leader\u2019s power is high when group mem\u00adbers all want to co\u00ador\u00addi\u00adnate their choices, but care much less about which choice is made, so long as ev\u00adery\u00adone \u201cmatches\u201d. Then the leader can just choose any\u00adthing they please, and ev\u00adery\u00adone will go along with it. (In\u00adter\u00adest\u00adingly, this sug\u00adgests that a leader can get high value from a group whose prefer\u00adences are or\u00adthog\u00ado\u00adnal to their own; pur\u00adsue power in groups which care about differ\u00adent things than you!) Con\u00adversely, a leader\u2019s power can be low in two ways:Group mem\u00adbers care a lot about which choice is made. In this case, the leader has lit\u00adtle free\u00addom to choose, and is mostly just a figure\u00adhead.Group mem\u00adbers only weakly care about co\u00ador\u00addi\u00adnat\u00ading. In this case, the group is in\u00adher\u00adently un\u00adsta\u00adble; lots of deals and con\u00adces\u00adsions are needed just to keep it to\u00adgether.Key thing to keep in mind: both of these con\u00addi\u00adtions are rel\u00ada\u00adtive-to-the-next-best-op\u00adtion. Group mem\u00adbers may care a lot about co\u00ador\u00addi\u00adnat\u00ading and only have weak prefer\u00adences about which choice is made, but if there\u2019s a com\u00adpeti\u00adtor who could co\u00ador\u00addi\u00adnate just as well and satisfy the weak prefer\u00adences bet\u00adter, then that com\u00adpeti\u00adtor\u2019s or\u00adders may be\u00adcome the new Schel\u00adling point.That\u2019s poli\u00adtics, in a nut\u00adshell: peo\u00adple try to turn their own or\u00adders\/\u200bpoli\u00adcies\/\u200bsug\u00adges\u00adtions into Schel\u00adling points for group ac\u00adtivity. They do this mainly by offer\u00ading con\u00adces\u00adsions and fa\u00advors to group mem\u00adbers\/\u200bsub\u00adgroups, in ex\u00adchange for those mem\u00adbers\u2019 sup\u00adport for the new Schel\u00adling point.Com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion and Gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adized Mar\u00adket EfficiencyIn demo\u00adcratic coun\u00adtries\/\u200bgroups, we have a built-in mechanism for com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion be\u00adtween would-be lead\u00aders. In other words, there\u2019s a Schel\u00adling point for when and how to switch Schel\u00adling points. That im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately sug\u00adgests a gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adized effi\u00adcient mar\u00adkets-style hy\u00adpoth\u00ade\u00adsis: lead\u00aders\u2019 power in such groups is driven by com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion to near-zero.What does that look like?Well, most peo\u00adple want to co\u00ador\u00addi\u00adnate; re\u00adgard\u00adless of what the rules are, we want to agree on what the rules are, oth\u00ader\u00adwise we end up in ex\u00adpen\u00adsive fights. But most peo\u00adple also have some prefer\u00adences about the rules\u2014i.e. poli\u00adti\u00adcal poli\u00adcies. Would-be lead\u00aders make promises: they pre\u00adcom\u00admit to cer\u00adtain poli\u00adcies, thereby cut\u00adting off cer\u00adtain op\u00adtions if they win (i.e. sac\u00adri\u00adfic\u00ading po\u00adten\u00adtial power), but gain\u00ading more sup\u00adport for their Schel\u00adling point in the pro\u00adcess. To max\u00adi\u00admize power, a would-be leader wants to just barely \u201cout\u00adbid\u201d all the other would-be lead\u00aders\u2014i.e. promise just a bit more to just a few more par\u00adties, keep\u00ading as much power as pos\u00adsi\u00adble while still win\u00adning the po\u00adsi\u00adtion.Of course, the other com\u00adpeti\u00adtors are try\u00ading to do the same thing. Solve for the equil\u00adibrium: the com\u00adpeti\u00adtors ei\u00adther bid away any de\u00adgree of free\u00addom which any con\u00adstituency cares about, or lose to some\u00adone who bids more. Gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adized effi\u00adcient mar\u00adkets kick in; the leader ends up with near-zero power. They\u2019re mostly just a figure\u00adhead im\u00adple\u00adment\u00ading all the poli\u00adcies they had to pre\u00adcom\u00admit to in or\u00adder to win the elec\u00adtion.Now, con\u00adsider the re\u00adverse\u2014a dic\u00adta\u00adtor or sin\u00adgle-party state or the like. How do they max\u00adi\u00admize power?To max\u00adi\u00admize power, they want to avoid gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adized effi\u00adcient mar\u00adkets\u2014i.e. they want to min\u00adi\u00admize com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion over the Schel\u00adling point. Elec\u00adtions en\u00adcourage com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion by pro\u00advid\u00ading a Schel\u00adling point for when and how to switch Schel\u00adling points; the power-hun\u00adgry leader wants ex\u00adactly the op\u00adpo\u00adsite of that. They want to make sure that there is no Schel\u00adling point for when and how to switch Schel\u00adling points.If a new Schel\u00adling point does show up (e.g. an op\u00adpo\u00adsi\u00adtion group), there won\u2019t be any agree\u00adment on when and how to switch, so there will prob\u00ada\u00adbly be some ex\u00adpen\u00adsive con\u00adflict (i.e. civil war). That ex\u00adpen\u00adsive con\u00adflict it\u00adself cre\u00adates a big po\u00adten\u00adtial en\u00adergy bar\u00adrier for any po\u00adten\u00adtial com\u00adpeti\u00adtor: for the peo\u00adple sup\u00adport\u00ading a switch to the new Schel\u00adling point, the ex\u00adpected gains from the switch must ex\u00adceed costs of the con\u00adflict. So from the dic\u00adta\u00adtor\u2019s stand\u00adpoint, the worse a civil war would be, the fewer con\u00adces\u00adsions and hand\u00adouts they need to make and the broader their power.(Of course, a dic\u00adta\u00adtor can use other strate\u00adgies to max\u00adi\u00admize power as well\u2014e.g. threat\u00aden\u00ading to kill peo\u00adple\/\u200bde\u00adstroy things if a new Schel\u00adling point comes along. But that\u2019s a sym\u00admet\u00adric strat\u00adegy: the dic\u00adta\u00adtor\u2019s en\u00ade\u00admies can just as eas\u00adily threaten to kill peo\u00adple\/\u200bde\u00adstroy things if no new Schel\u00adling point is adopted. The dic\u00adta\u00adtor may have an ad\u00advan\u00adtage in re\u00adsources, but that gap can in prin\u00adci\u00adple be closed by other means. It\u2019s mainly the lack of a Schel\u00adling point for switch\u00ading Schel\u00adling points which con\u00adfers an asym\u00admet\u00adric ad\u00advan\u00adtage to the in\u00adcum\u00adbent.)Democ\u00adracy\u2019s Seedy UnderbellyBased on the pre\u00advi\u00adous sec\u00adtion, some\u00adone ac\u00adcus\u00adtomed to a \u201cdemoc\u00adracy=good, dic\u00adta\u00adtor=bad\u201d wor\u00adld\u00adview might think that lead\u00aders be\u00ading forced to bar\u00adgain away all their po\u00adten\u00adtial power is good news. \u201cLead\u00aders are just figure\u00adheads\u201d and \u201clead\u00aders are just im\u00adple\u00adment\u00ading the poli\u00adcies which won the elec\u00adtion\u201d both say the same thing. This is \u201cgood\u201d, yes?The failure modes of democ\u00adracy are baked-in here too.Con\u00adsider a would-be leader figur\u00ading out the perfect mix of promises and con\u00adces\u00adsions to make, in or\u00adder to win an elec\u00adtion. From their point of view, differ\u00adent peo\u00adple want\u00ading op\u00adpo\u00adsite things is a prob\u00adlem. Mov\u00ading the meetup point closer to one neigh\u00adbor\u00adhood means mov\u00ading it fur\u00adther from an\u00adother. But di\u00admen\u00adsion\u00adal\u00adity is a ma\u00adjor boon for the leader: there\u2019s thou\u00adsands of di\u00admen\u00adsions along which policy can change. If Alice cares strongly about one par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar di\u00admen\u00adsion\u2014like, say, gov\u00adern\u00adment sup\u00adport for her pro\u00adfes\u00adsion\u2014which no\u00adbody else cares about very much, then that promise can be made to Alice with\u00adout los\u00ading the sup\u00adport of some\u00adbody else. It\u2019s spe\u00adcial-in\u00adter\u00adest poli\u00adtics: look for poli\u00adcies with fo\u00adcused benefits and diffuse costs. Pile many such poli\u00adcies to\u00adgether, and you have a win\u00adning coal\u00adi\u00adtion.That out\u00adcome may be \u201ceffi\u00adcient\u201d in the sense that no other bun\u00addle of poli\u00adcies can beat it in an elec\u00adtion, but that\u2019s very differ\u00adent from \u201ceffi\u00adcient\u201d in the sense of \u201cnot wast\u00ading ridicu\u00adlous amounts of re\u00adsources on pork-bar\u00adrel pro\u00adjects and reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtory bar\u00adri\u00aders to en\u00adtry\u201d.Now, sup\u00adpose we\u2019re un\u00adhappy with this out\u00adcome. We want to build a bet\u00adter world. What can we do?Ob\u00advi\u00adously \u201crun for office\u201d is not a work\u00adable an\u00adswer here. Gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adized effi\u00adcient mar\u00adkets mean we can\u2019t win an elec\u00adtion with\u00adout trad\u00ading away any abil\u00adity to en\u00adact our preferred poli\u00adcies.If we have some ex\u00adter\u00adnal re\u00adsources\u2014e.g. a gi\u00adant pile of money\u2014then we could po\u00adten\u00adtially use that to \u201cforce\u201d the poli\u00adti\u00adcal equil\u00adibrium in a differ\u00adent di\u00adrec\u00adtion. This could look like old-fash\u00adioned bribery, where we just pay some stake\u00adhold\u00aders to back our preferred Schel\u00adling point. It could look like a pay\u00adment to the poli\u00adti\u00adcal sys\u00adtem as a whole, e.g. offer\u00ading a pri\u00advate sub\u00adsidy for road re\u00adpair. It could in\u00advolve re\u00adsources other than money, as in a celebrity or me\u00addia out\u00adlet offer\u00ading an en\u00addorse\u00adment, or a na\u00adtion offer\u00ading some con\u00adces\u00adsion in ex\u00adchange for lower tar\u00adiffs. We could change the op\u00adtions available to the group via tech\u00adnol\u00adogy, e.g. bit\u00adcoin. We could sim\u00adply try to con\u00advince peo\u00adple to sup\u00adport our preferred poli\u00adcies\u2014though this means com\u00adpet\u00ading in memes\u00adpace, which has gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adized effi\u00adcient mar\u00adkets of its own.

Then the leader can just choose any\u00adthing they please, and ev\u00adery\u00adone will go along with it.  Could you please elab\u00ado\u00adrate?Also, I have an out\u00adsider\u2019s view of Amer\u00adi\u00adcan (or, in\u00addeed, Western in gen\u00aderal) poli\u00adtics, so I can be wrong, but I think an ar\u00adgu\u00adment from em\u00adpirics could be made against this:  It\u2019s spe\u00adcial-in\u00adter\u00adest poli\u00adtics: look for poli\u00adcies with fo\u00adcused benefits and diffuse costs. Pile many such poli\u00adcies to\u00adgether, and you have a win\u00adning coal\u00adi\u00adtion. At least in the two most re\u00adcent Amer\u00adi\u00adcan elec\u00adtions (2016 and then the 2018 midterms) it seems like it was very much not the case of peo\u00adple rac\u00ading for the most fo\u00adcused benefits and most diffuse cost, but rather for the most effi\u00adcient way to gal\u00adva\u00adnize their vot\u00aders, cost be damned. Think of the wall on the Mex\u00adi\u00adcan bor\u00adder\u2014it would prob\u00ada\u00adbly be ex\u00ador\u00adbitantly ex\u00adpen\u00adsive, in\u00adclud\u00ading to those that voted for it, but it was a very pow\u00ader\u00adful sym\u00adbol that peo\u00adple who felt strongly about the is\u00adsue could rally be\u00adhind. 538 here do a kind of liter\u00ada\u00adture re\u00adview\u2014and find, amongst other things, that racial at\u00adti\u00adtudes mat\u00adtered more in 2016 than in any re\u00adcent elec\u00adtion \u2014 even 2008, when the pres\u00adence of an Afri\u00adcan-Amer\u00adi\u00adcan can\u00addi\u00addate shaped the poli\u00adti\u00adcal con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtion. Un\u00adless I mi\u00ads\u00adun\u00adder\u00adstand the idea, I don\u2019t think is\u00adsues of race have a nar\u00adrow fo\u00adcused scope of benefits and costs diffuse enough not to be no\u00adticed by other vot\u00aders. I also think this point Would-be lead\u00aders make promises: they pre\u00adcom\u00admit to cer\u00adtain poli\u00adcies, thereby cut\u00adting off cer\u00adtain op\u00adtions if they win (i.e. sac\u00adri\u00adfic\u00ading po\u00adten\u00adtial power), but gain\u00ading more sup\u00adport for their Schel\u00adling point in the pro\u00adcess. makes an as\u00adsump\u00adtion of vot\u00aders be\u00ading more-or-less perfectly in\u00adformed about what the Schel\u00adling point (poli\u00adcies and laws) ac\u00adtu\u00adally is. What if a leader could get elected by pre-com\u00admit\u00ading to cer\u00adtain poli\u00adcies, but then ac\u00adtu\u00adally not act on them, while man\u00adag\u00ading to con\u00advince the vot\u00aders that they, in fact, are do\u00ading their best to im\u00adple\u00adment these poli\u00adcies, but are failing to for a cer\u00adtain (prob\u00ada\u00adbly not a very falsifi\u00adable) rea\u00adson?

If, when faced with a choice of writ\u00ading about (a) things that are real but dull vs (b) things that are not real but get clicks, no one has an in\u00adcen\u00adtive to do (a), how do you form a view of the world?

Say, Alice runs for pres\u00adi\u00addent on a con\u00adser\u00adva\u00adtive\/\u200bjobs-cen\u00adtric plat\u00adform, com\u00admits to out\u00adlaw work visas and ex\u00adpunge all for\u00adeign work\u00aders, and wins the race, and says that she\u2019s work\u00ading hard to achieve that goal. Bob is a to\u00adtal sup\u00adporter and he\u2019s sure that she does ex\u00adactly that and thinks that de\u00adpor\u00adta\u00adtions are only a cou\u00adple days away. Char\u00adlie may be skep\u00adti\u00adcal about the promise, be\u00adcause sounded very rad\u00adi\u00adcal and cam\u00adpaign-y, but thinks she\u2019s prob\u00ada\u00adbly go\u00ading to cut work visas, but not be able to ex\u00adpunge for\u00adeign\u00aders already in the coun\u00adtry. Dave agrees with Char\u00adlie that the promise was rad\u00adi\u00adcal and will not be fol\u00adlowed through on fully, but not on what will ac\u00adtu\u00adally hap\u00adpen\u2014he thinks Alice will be able to ex\u00adpunge already pre\u00adsent for\u00adeign\u00aders, but never risk the poli\u00adti\u00adcal tur\u00admoil of re\u00admov\u00ading work visas. Erin is a to\u00adtal skep\u00adtic and thinks Alice is merely ex\u00adploit\u00ading the vot\u00aders, and is ac\u00adtu\u00adally not do\u00ading any\u00adthing about the for\u00adeign\u00aders, and fi\u00adnally Frank is a con\u00adspir\u00adacy the\u00ado\u00adrist and thinks that Alice is se\u00adcretly work\u00ading with a ca\u00adbal of global\u00adists to bring even more for\u00adeign\u00aders (maybe even ille\u00adgally!) in while bul\u00adlshit\u00adting him.All of these peo\u00adple have differ\u00adent Schel\u00adling points! If Zack, a for\u00adeigner, asks Bob to loan him money, Bob is go\u00ading to re\u00adfuse, be\u00adcause he thinks Zack will be kicked out of the coun\u00adtry to\u00admor\u00adrow and he\u2019s not get\u00adting his money back. If he asks Erin, she\u2019s likely to agree, be\u00adcause she doesn\u2019t be\u00adlieve Zack is go\u00ading any\u00adwhere.Now, sure, there\u2019s only so many ways to in\u00adter\u00adpret a sin\u00adgle cam\u00adpaign promise, and there are bound to be groups within the voter base that will agree on what Alice will ac\u00adtu\u00adally do, the Schel\u00adling point will work for them\u2014but since Alice is in\u00adcen\u00adtivized to make a lot of fo\u00adcused-benefit-dis\u00adperse-cost promises, vot\u00aders who agree on what her ac\u00adtions on a cer\u00adtain policy are, may dis\u00adagree on what her ac\u00adtions re\u00adgard\u00ading a differ\u00adent policy are.

Now, maybe\nthere's some magic technique for picking out the information that\nmatters, passing over the rest, and writing out a single, coherent\nstory in one pass through all the papers you can find. If that\ntechnique exists, I have no idea what it is.\nSo when every paper brings up ten new questions and twenty papers to\nstart answering them, I need a system to keep my notes organized. I\nneed notes that let me jump back and forth between papers without\nlosing my place, draw links between papers, and store lists of\ncitations to come back to. Here's how I do it.\n\nStoring papers with Zotero\nThe first tool I use is Zotero, a reference\nmanager. Zotero's job is to store all the actual papers I come across,\nalong with information like data on how to cite the papers and any\ntags they might have been published with. It can grab that information\nfrom my web browser, whether from a journal's website or someplace\nlike Google Scholar or PubMed. It's also great for quickly putting\ntogether a bibliography, using bibtex or similar programs, when I want\nto write up some results.\n\n\n\nZotero stores the papers I want to\nread and reference. I scaled up the font size here to make it readable\nin a tiny blog image.\nZotero isn't the only choice for reference managers.\nMendeley is another popular choice, and\nthere are a\nwhole bunch more\nout there. I picked Zotero arbitrarily a few years ago, but it's\nworking out well because of its emacs integration.\nKeeping notes with Emacs and Org mode\nYou see, Zotero has some note-taking functions, and I used to keep my\nnotes there, but there were some problems. Notes are stored as\nseparate files for each paper, but I want to cross-reference notes\nfrom a lot of different papers at once. And while the editor has some\nrich-text capabilities (e.g. bold and italic text), it's missing\nimportant things I need in my notes, like the ability to typeset\nequations.\nThat's where Emacs and its\nextension Org mode come in. To borrow a term\nfrom Perl enthusiasts, Org mode is the swiss army chainsaw of text\ndocument formats. Org mode documents have a lot of features, and it's\nway beyond this post's scope to describe them all. For the purpose of\nresearch notes, the most useful things it lets me do are:\n\nI can store my notes in a hierarchical tree structure, and I can\n  hide parts of the tree from view in order to focus on other parts.\nI can put hyperlinks into my notes, including links to papers,\n  websites, or other parts of the file.\nI can put math in my notes using Latex, and view the typeset\n  equations right in my Emacs buffer.\n\n\n\n\nA sample from my notes file. You\ncan see the tree structure of the file, some links to papers, and a\nlittle bit of inline math, using Latex.\nGluing it all together with zotxt\nNow, see those links to papers in my notes buffer? I didn't have to\ncopy and paste them from anywhere. I inserted them with just three\nkeystrokes each. So far, I've just described some useful pieces of\nsoftware, but the interesting part of my workflow is how they fit\ntogether.\nzotxt is an extension that lets\nother programs talk to Zotero, and Emacs has a package to talk to it.\nIt's even structured specifically to work with Org mode documents.\nWith zotxt, my workflow looks like this:\n\nI find a paper I want to look at somewhere on the internet.\nI use Zotero's browser plugin to save it to Zotero. Hopefully it\n  grabs the paper itself and this happens in one click; if the site\n  doesn't play along, I spend a minute grabbing a pdf and feeding it\n  to Zotero.\nI insert a link to the Zotero entry into my notes file in Emacs. I\n  can do this with the key chords C-c \" \". I don't need to further\n  specify what paper I want to grab: the browser plugin leaves the\n  paper selected in Zotero, and zotxt can grab the selected paper.\nWhen I want to read the paper, I go to the link and tell Emacs to\n  open the paper in my system PDF viewer. The key chords for this are\n  C-c \" a, and then selecting the PDF attachment from the Helm\n  window that appears (usually I just type pdf RET).\nWhen I'm reading a paper and see a citation that might be useful, I\n  look it up on the internet and repeat this process to store a note\n  linking to it.\n\nIt took me a while to get it set up to my liking, so here's how I did\nit:\n\nFirst, install zotxt. If you're\n  using Zotero as a firefox extension, you just need to install zotxt\n  as another extension. If you're using the standalone Zotero client,\n  you can still do it: download the extension file from that link,\n  then go to the Add-Ons Manager under the Tools menu and find the\n  option to install an add-on from a file.\n\n\n\n\nThe menu option looks like\nthis.\n\nNext, install the zotxt package in emacs. If your\n  package manager is set up, you\n  can just type M-x package-install RET zotxt RET.\nNow, when org-zotxt-mode is active, you can use its functions in\n  your org-mode buffers. You can search for papers and insert them\n  with C-c \" i, insert the currently-selected paper in Zotero with\n  C-u C-c \" i, and open a paper's PDF or other related files by\n  moving the cursor to a link and typing C-c \" a. However, you might\n  want a little bit more setup to deal with some annoyances.\nYou probably want to have org-zotxt-mode automatically activated\n  in all your org-mode documents. To make that happen, you can add\n  some code to your .emacs file to start up this mode on all your\n  org-mode buffers - see below this list for the .emacs\n  configuration I use.\nIf you want to insert a link to the currently-selected item a lot,\n  C-u C-c \" i is an awkward sequence to type. I rebound it to C-c \"\n  \".\nYou might notice that when you insert a link to a paper, the text of\n  that link is a full citation. That might be what you want, but I\n  just want the authors, paper name, and year. It took me a bit of\n  hacking to get around that: it's possible to tell the emacs zotxt\n  interface to use a different citation format than the default, but I\n  had to throw together a little XML file to give it a shorter format\n  than a full citation. (This may not be the easiest or cleanest way\n  to do it, but it works!)\n  That XML file is here. To use it, go into\n  your Zotero preferences and select Cite -> Styles, and add the file.\n  It should appear in the menu as \"mkbehr's short reference format\".\n  Then add the last two lines in the .emacs snippet below, and you\n  should get shorter citations.\nYou probably want to install the\n  Helm package, to make zotxt's\n  search interface easier to navigate. That link should tell you\n  everything you need to know.\n\nHere's that .emacs setup code:\n;; Activate org-zotxt-mode in org-mode buffers\n(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-zotxt-mode 1)))\n;; Bind something to replace the awkward C-u C-c \" i\n(define-key org-mode-map\n  (kbd \"C-c \\\" \\\"\") (lambda () (interactive)\n                      (org-zotxt-insert-reference-link '(4))))\n;; Change citation format to be less cumbersome in files.\n;; You'll need to install mkbehr-short into your style manager first.\n(eval-after-load \"zotxt\"\n'(setq zotxt-default-bibliography-style \"mkbehr-short\"))\n\nOf course, I'm not done tinkering to make my workflow better. I hear\ngood things about the org-ref\nand helm-bibtex\npackages - if only I can keep an up-to-date bibtex file as I add papers\nto my library, I can associate links with not only a paper's pdf, but\nalso that paper's section of my notes file. And I haven't found a\nsmooth way to take a paper and pull up the papers it cites in my\nbrowser. But until then, I'm pretty happy with this setup.\nHappy researching!\n\n\n\nemacs\nresearch\n\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\nNext post\n\nComments\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nComments powered by Disqus\n\n\n\n\n            Contents \u00a9 2015         Michael Behr - Powered by         Nikola\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","rejected":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 By Edge Foundation, Inc.

Gershman, Eric J. Horvitz, and Joshua Tenenbaum published \u201cComputational rationality: A converging paradigm for intelligence in brains, minds, and machines\u201d in Science, 17 July 2015. They announced that they and their colleagues had something new underway: an effort to identify the principles, perhaps the laws, of intelligence, just as Newton once discovered the laws of motion.\nFormerly, any commonalities among a stroll in the park, the turbulence of a river, the revolution of a carriage wheel, the trajectory of a cannon ball, or the paths of the planets, seemed preposterous. It was Newton who found the underlying generalities that explained each of them (and so much more) at a fundamental level.\nNow comes a similarly audacious pursuit to subsume under general principles, perhaps even laws, the essence of intelligence wherever it\u2019s found. \u201cTruth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things,\u201d Newton said.\nSo far as intelligence goes, we are pre-Newtonian. Commonalities of intelligence shared by cells, dolphins, plants, birds, robots and humans seem, if not preposterous, at least far-fetched.\nYet rich exchanges among artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and the neurosciences, for a start, aim exactly toward Newton\u2019s \u201ctruth in simplicity,\u201d those underlying principles (maybe laws) that will connect these disparate entities together. The pursuit\u2019s formal name is computational rationality. What is it exactly, we ask? Who, or what, exhibits it?\n\u00a0The pursuit is inspired by the general agreement in the sciences of mind that intelligence arises not from the medium that embodies it\u2014whether biological or electronic\u2014but the way interactions among elements in the system are arranged. Intelligence begins when a system identifies a goal, learns (from a teacher, a training set, or an experience) and then moves on autonomously, adapting to a complex, changing environment. Another way of looking at this is that intelligent entities are networks, often hierarchies of intelligent systems, humans certainly among the most complex, but congeries of humans even more so.\nThe three scientists postulate that three core ideas characterize intelligence. First, intelligent agents have goals, and form beliefs and plan actions that will best reach those goals. Second, calculating ideal best choices may be intractable for real-world problems, but rational algorithms can come close enough (\u201csatisfice\u201d in Herbert Simon\u2019s term) and incorporate the costs of computation. Third, these algorithms can be rationally adapted to the entity\u2019s specific needs, either off-line through engineering or evolutionary design, or online through meta-reasoning mechanisms that select the best strategy on the spot for a given situation.\nThough barely begun, the inquiry into computational rationality is already large and embraces multitudes. For example, biologists now talk easily about cognition, from the cellular to the symbolic level. Neuroscientists can identify computational strategies shared by both humans and animals. Dendrologists can show that trees communicate with each other (slowly) to warn of nearby enemies, like wood beetles: activate the toxins, neighbor.\nThe humanities themselves are comfortably at home here too, though it\u2019s taken many years for most of us to see that. And of course here belongs artificial intelligence, a key illuminator, inspiration, and provocateur.\nIt\u2019s news now; it will stay news because it\u2019s so fundamental; its evolving revelations will help us see our world, our universe, in a completely new way. And for those atremble at the perils of super-intelligent entities, surely understanding intelligence at this fundamental level is one of our best defenses.\u00a0\n \n Return to Table of Contents  \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n 2018 : WHAT IS THE LAST QUESTION?  \n\n  \n 2017 : WHAT SCIENTIFIC TERM OR\u00a0CONCEPT OUGHT TO BE MORE WIDELY KNOWN?  \n\n  \n 2016 : WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE MOST INTERESTING RECENT [SCIENTIFIC] NEWS?

But as phrased, I think this particular formulation when not paired with any caveats creates just a little more panic than is warranted.\nBefore I go further, Ioannidis\u2019 evidence:\nHe starts with simple statistics. Most studies are judged to have \u201cdiscovered\u201d a result if they reach p < 0.05, that is, if there is 5% probability or less the findings are due to mere chance (this is the best case scenario, where the study is totally free from bias or methodological flaws).\nSuppose you throw a dart at the Big Chart O\u2019 Human Metabolic Pathways and supplement your experimental group with the chemical you hit. Then ten years later you come back and see how many of them died of heart attacks.\nMost chemicals on the Big Chart probably don\u2019t prevent heart attacks. Let\u2019s say only one in a thousand do. Maybe your study will successfully find that 1\/1000. But the 999 inactive chemicals will also throw up about 50 (999 * 5%) false positives significant at the 5% level. Therefore, even if you conduct your study perfectly, and it shows a significant decrease in heart attacks, there\u2019s about a 98% chance it\u2019s false.\nOne would hope medical scientists plan their studies with a little more care than throwing a dart at a metabolic chart. Yet many don\u2019t; a lot of genetic research is conducted by checking every single gene against the characteristic of interest and seeing if any stick. And even when scientists have well-thought out theories, the inherent difficulty of medicine means they probably have less than a 50-50 chance of being right the first time, which means a 5% significance level has a less than 5% predictive value.\nAnd this isn\u2019t even counting publication bias or poor methodology or conflicts of interest or anything like that.\nDisturbingly, this problem seems to be borne out in empirical tests. Amgen Pharmaceuticals says it repeated experiments in 53 important papers and was only able to confirm 6. And Ioannidis himself did a re-analysis which is quoted as finding that \u201c41% of the most influential studies in medicine have been convincingly shown to be wrong or significantly exaggerated.\u201d\nSo I don\u2019t at all disagree with the general consensus that this is a huge problem. But I do disagree with the following statements:\n1. 90% of all medical research is wrong\n2. A given study you read, or your doctor reads, is 90% likely to be wrong.\n3. 90% of the things doctors believe, presumably based on these medical findings, is wrong.\n4. This proves the medical establishment is clueless and hopelessly irrational and that two smart people working in a basement for five minutes can discover a new medical science far better than what all doctors could have produced in seventy years.\nIs 90% of all medical research wrong?\nAs far as I can tell, there is no source at all for the 90% figure. I can\u2019t find it in any of Ioannidis\u2019 studies and indeed they contradict it. His table of predictive values of different studies doesn\u2019t have any entries that correspond to 90% (\u201cunderpowered exploratory epidemiological study\u201d is relatively close with 88%, but this is just for that one type of study, which is known to be especially bad). The Atlantic sums it up as:\nHis model predicted, in different fields of medical research, rates of wrongness roughly corresponding to the observed rates at which findings were later convincingly refuted: 80 percent of non-randomized studies (by far the most common type) turn out to be wrong, as do 25 percent of supposedly gold-standard randomized trials, and as much as 10 percent of the platinum-standard large randomized trials.\nNotice which number is conspicuously missing from that excerpt.\nNow another study of his did show that in 90% of studies with very large effect sizes, later research eventually found the effect size to be smaller, but this was out of a pool of studies specifically selected for being surprising and likely to be false. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the source of the number and if it were that would be terrible.\nAs far as I can tell, this started from a quote in an Atlantic article on Ioannidis which included the line \u201che charges that as much as 90 percent of the published medical information that doctors rely on is flawed\u201d. This then got turned into the title of a Time article \u201cA Researcher\u2019s Claim: 90% of Medical Research Is Wrong\u201d, which itself got perverted to 90% of Medical Research Is Completely False.\nSo an unsourced quote that up to 90% of studies are flawed has somehow turned into a rallying cry that it has been proven that at least 90% of studies are false. To take this seriously we would have to believe that the numbers for all research are the same as the numbers for the poorly conducted epidemiological studies or the studies specifically selected for surprising results. I guess having a nice round number is good insofar as it makes the public pay attention to this field, but as far as actual numbers go, it\u2019s kind of made up.\nIs any given study you read, or your doctor reads, 90% likely to be wrong?\nBut let\u2019s take the above number at face value and say that 90% of medical studies are wrong. Fine. Does that mean the last medical study you read about in Scientific American, or that your doctor used to recommend you a new drug, is wrong?\nNo. Let\u2019s look at the Medical Evidence Pyramid.\nThe medical evidence pyramid is much like all pyramids, in that the bottom levels are infested with snakes and booby traps and vengeful medical evidence mummies. It\u2019s only after you reach the top few levels that you get the gold and jewels and precious, precious mummy powder.\nThis plays out in the same table of Ioannidis\u2019 speculations we saw before. While an in vitro study of the type used to identify possible drug targets might have a positive predictive value of 0.1%, a good meta-analysis or great RCT has a positive predictive value of 85%; that is, it\u2019s 85% likely to be true.\nThere are only two reasons someone might hear about the studies on the snake-infested bottom levels of the pyramid. Number one, that person is a specialist in the field who is valiantly trying to read through the entire niche medical journal the paper was published in. Or number two, the study found something incredible like DONUTS CURE CANCER IN A SAMPLE OF THREE LAB RATS!!! and the media decided to pick up on it. Hopefully everyone already ignores studies of the DONUTS CURE CANCER IN A SAMPLE OF THREE LAB RATES!!! type studies; if not, there\u2019s really not much I can say to you.\nBut most of the medical results that you hear about are the ones that get published in important journals and are trumpeted far and wide as important medical results. These are closer to the top of the pyramid than to the bottom. They\u2019re usually big expensive studies on thousands of people. Since the universities, hospitals, and corporations sponsoring them aren\u2019t idiots, they usually hire a decent statistician or two to make sure that they don\u2019t spend $300,000 testing something only to have a letter to the editor of the NEJM point out that they forgot to blind their subjects so it\u2019s totally worthless. And finally, in many cases you would only run a study that big and expensive if you had something plausible to test \u2013 you\u2019re not going to spend $300,000 just to throw a dart at the Big Chart O\u2019 Human Metabolic Pathways and see what happens.\nSo these studies that people actually hear about are bigger, they have more incentives to get their methodology right, and they\u2019re testing propositions with high plausibility. How do they do?\nI said above that one of Ioannidis\u2019 studies was frequently quoted as saying that \u201c41% of the most influential studies in medicine have been convincingly shown to be wrong or significantly exaggerated.\u201d\nThis is from a great study I totally endorse, but the 41% number was maximized for scariness. If I wanted to bias my reporting the other direction, I could equally well report the same results as \u201cOnly about 5% of influential medical experiments with adequate sample size have later been contradicted.\u201d\nHow? Ioannidis got his result by taking all medical studies with over 1000 citations in the \u201990s, of which there were 49. Of these, 4 were negative results (ie \u201cX doesn\u2019t work\u201d) so he threw them out. This is the first part I think is kind of unfair. Yes, negative results aren\u2019t as sexy as positive results, but they\u2019re still influential medical research, and if Ioannidis is quoted as saying that X% of medical findings are later contradicted when he means that X% of positive medical findings are, that\u2019s not quite fair.\nAnnnnyway, of the 45 famous studies with positive findings, 11 didn\u2019t really get tested and so we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re right or wrong. Eliminating these is also a potential bias, because we expect that studies which seem sketchy are more likely to be replicated so people can find out if they\u2019re actually right. Ioannidis quite rightly set himself a higher bar by not eliminating them, but the quote about 41% of studies being wrong does seem to have gone back eliminated them \u2013 at least that\u2019s the only way I can make the study numbers add up to 41% (the numbers given in the study actually say 32% of these studies failed to replicate).\nSo our 41% number is based off of 34 studies, best described as \u201c34 famous medical studies that found positive findings ie the least believable kind of finding, plus were suspicious enough that someone wanted to replicate them\u201d.\nOf these 34 studies, 7 were outright contradicted. Bad? Definitely. But for example, one of them was a study with a sample size of nine patients. Another study may well have been correct, but the results were interpreted wrongly (it said that estrogen decreased lipoprotein levels which everyone assumed meant decreased heart disease, but in fact later studies found increased heart disease without necessarily disproving the lipoprotein levels). Five of the six others were epidemiological trials, firmly on the middle of the pyramid. Only two of these contradicted studies were a true experiment with a sample size of >10.\n(even here, I am sort of skeptical. Three of these disproven studies, two epidemiologicals and an experimental, purported to show Vitamin E decreased heart disease. Then a single better trial showed that Vitamin E did not decrease heart disease. While recognizing the last trial was better, it does seem like something more complicated is going on here than \u201call three of the earlier trials were just wrong\u201d, and I\u2019ve recently been convinced antioxidant research is a huge minefield where tiny differences in protocol can cause big differences in results. But fine, let\u2019s grant this one and say there were two outright-contradicted experiments.)\nSo aside from the seven that were outright wrong, another seven were listed as \u201coverstating their results\u201d.\nThere are a couple of problems that bothered me here. One of them was that Ioannidis decided to count studies as contradicting each other if relative risk in one study was half or less than in the other study, \u201cregardless of whether confidence intervals might overlap or not\u201d. So even if a study effectively said \u201cHere is a wide range of possible results, we think it\u2019s about here in the middle but our research is consistent with it being anywhere in this range\u201d, if another study got somewhere else in that range, the first study was marked as \u201cexaggerated\u201d.\nThe second problem is, once again, poor studies versus poor interpretations. Ioannidis cites as an example of an exaggerated study one lasting a year and showing that the drug zidovudine helped slow the progression of HIV to AIDS. It concluded that giving HIV patients long-term zidovudine was probably a good idea. A later study lasted longer, and said that yes, zidovudine worked for a year, but then it stopped working. Because the earlier study had suggested longer-term zidovudine, it was marked as \u201cexaggerated results\u201d, even though the results of both studies were totally consistent with one another (both found that zidovudine worked for the first year). This is probably of little consolation to AIDS patients who were treated with a useless drug, but it seems pretty important if we\u2019re investigating study methodology.\nSo the way I got my 5% figure was to take the two experimental studies with decent sample sizes which were actually contradicted and compare them to the 38 large experimental studies total that started the experiment.\nSo this suggests that if you see a large experimental study being trumpeted in the medical literature, the chance that it will be found to be totally false (as opposed to true but exaggerated) within ten years or so is only about 5% \u2013 which if you understand p-values is about what you should have believed already.\n(I think. This requires quite a few assumptions, not the least of which is that my calculations above are correct!)\nAlso worth noting: Ioannidis\u2019 experiment did not investigate the absolute highest level of the medical pyramid, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. I expect the best of these to be better than any individual study.\n3. Are 90% of the things doctors believe, presumably based on medical findings, wrong?\nAfter going through the steps above, it should be pretty obvious that the answer is no, because doctors are mostly reading famous influential studies like the ones mentioned above, which are at worst 40% and at best 5% wrong.\nBut there\u2019s another factor to be taken into account, which is that why would you only read one study on something when lots of important findings have been investigated multiple times?\nSuppose that you\u2019re throwing darts at the Big Chart O\u2019 Human Metabolic Pathways, with your 1\/1000 base rate of true hypotheses. You run a very good methodologically sound study and find p = .05. But now there\u2019s still only a 1\/50 chance your hypothesis is correct.\nBut another team in China runs the same study, and they also find p = .05. We expect the Chinese to get false to true results at a rate of one to two (because the 1 in the 1\/50 stays 1, but the 50 is divided by 20 to produce approximately 2. Wow, I\u2019m even worse at explaining math than I am at doing it.)\nNow a team in, oh, let\u2019s say Turkey runs the same study, and they also find p = .05. We expect the Turks to get false to true results at a rate of one to ten, for, uh, the same math reasons as the Chinese. When the, um, Icelanders repeat the study, our odds go to one to two hundred.\nSo we started with 1000:1 odds, the first study brought us up to 50:1 odds, the second study to 2:1 odds, the third study to 1:10 odds, and the fourth study to 1:200 odds, ie we are now 99.5% sure we\u2019re right.\nReal medicine is both better and worse than this. It\u2019s better in that we often have dozens of studies rather than just four. It\u2019s worse in that the studies are not all so methodologically sound that we can multiply our odds by 20 each time (to put it lightly).\nBut some of them are, and once we get enough of them, the base rate problems which plague individual medical findings go away very quickly. Even if only one of the studies is methodologically sound, if the reason they\u2019re studying their topic is because a bunch of other less believable studies all got positive results, that\u2019s a much better base rate than \u201cbecause I hit it with my dart\u201d.\nWhen doctors say that, for example, iron supplements help anaemia, it\u2019s not because they hit iron on their Big Chart O\u2019 Human Metabolic Pathways, then ran a single study, got p = .05, and rushed off to publish a medical textbook. It\u2019s because they knew hemoglobin had iron in it, there are at least 21 randomized controlled studies, probably some had p-values closer to .001 than to .05 even though I don\u2019t have any of them in front of me to check, and eventually some really really smart statisticians at the Cochrane Collaboration gave it their seal of approval. Most doctors\u2019 beliefs aren\u2019t on quite this high a level, but most doctors\u2019 beliefs aren\u2019t on the \u201cSomeone threw a dart, then did one study\u201d level either.\n4. Does this prove the medical establishment is clueless and hopelessly irrational and that two smart people working in a basement for five minutes can discover a new medical science far better than what all doctors could have produced in seventy years?\nA lot of people seem to go from Ioannidis\u2019 experiment to something like \u201cSo I guess everyone in medicine is just clueless about how science and statistics work. I\u2019ll go read a couple of medical studies and then be able to outperform everyone in this totally flawed field.\u201d\n(important note: I\u2019m not accusing MetaMed of this! They seem pretty sane. I am accusing some people I come across in the community who are much more enthusiastic than the relatively sober MetaMed people of doing something like this.)\nBut the problem isn\u2019t that no one in medicine is familiar with Ioannidis\u2019 research. It\u2019s that they\u2019re not really sure what to do about it and figuring out a plan and implementing it will take time and effort.\nIoannidis\u2019 work isn\u2019t exactly secret. I\u2019ve hung out with groups of residents (ie trainee doctors) who have discussed Ioannidis\u2019 findings over the dinner table. According to The Atlantic\nTo say that Ioannidis\u2019s work has been embraced would be an understatement. His PLoS Medicine paper is the most downloaded in the journal\u2019s history, and it\u2019s not even Ioannidis\u2019s most-cited work\u2014that would be a paper he published in Nature Genetics on the problems with gene-link studies. Other researchers are eager to work with him: he has published papers with 1,328 different co-authors at 538 institutions in 43 countries, he says. Last year he received, by his estimate, invitations to speak at 1,000 conferences and institutions around the world, and he was accepting an average of about five invitations a month until a case last year of excessive-travel-induced vertigo led him to cut back.\nSo if so many people are aware of this, why isn\u2019t the problem getting fixed more quickly?\nAn optimist could say the problem isn\u2019t getting fixed because there is no problem. A vast volume of embarassingly wrong medical literature gets published, inflates the publishers\u2019 resumes, and everyone else ignores it and concentrates on the not-really-so-bad large randomized trials. To the post-cynic it is all a smooth, well-functioning machine.\nA pessimist might say that the problem isn\u2019t getting fixed because it\u2019s impossible. The average medical hypothesis is always going to have a low base rate of being true \u2013 in fact, if we force scientists to only study high base-rate hypotheses, by definition everything we discover will be boring. There will never be enough resources to apply huge rigorous trials to every one of the millions of things worth studying. So we\u2019re always going to have weak studies about low-base rate hypotheses, which is what Ioannidis is attacking as the recipe for failure.\nA realist might point out there are some things we can do, but it involves coordinating a huge and complicated system with many moving parts. Journals can force trials to register before they conduct their experiments to avoid publication bias. The scientific community can give more status to people who perform important replications and especially important negative replications. Study authors and the media can come up with better ways to report their results to doctors and the public without blowing them out of proportion. Statisticians can\u2026actually, anything I say statisticians can do is just going to be a mysterious answer, along the lines of \u201cdo better statistics stuff\u201d, so I\u2019m not going to embarass myself by completing this sentence except to postulate that I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s some recommendation that could complete it usefully.\nBut all these things involve vague entities who aren\u2019t really actors (\u201cthe scientific community\u201d, \u201cthe media\u201d) acting in ways that are kind of against their immediate incentives. This is hard to make people do and usually involves a lot of grassroots coordination effort. Which is going on. But it takes time.\nBut no matter what happens, I think a useful epistemic habit is to be very skeptical of individual studies, and skeptical but not too skeptical of large randomized trials, good meta-analyses, and general medical consensus when supported by an evidence base.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.

I, for one, don\u2019t go around claiming that 90% of research studies are false; I believe Ioannides only found a little more than half of medical studies were disconfirmed by later experiments.  90% of all *pre-clinical cancer studies* are later disconfirmed, which does mean that if you see a study that says \u201cX cures cancer\u201d but X hasn\u2019t made it to clinical trials yet, X probably *doesn\u2019t* cure cancer.\n2.  I don\u2019t expect most things doctors believe to be wrong.  I don\u2019t even expect most things *people* believe to be wrong; after all, most things people believe are of the form \u201cwater is wet,\u201d so uncontroversial that we barely notice them as beliefs.  What I *do* expect to be wrong are beliefs that aren\u2019t based on a model of the world.  \n\u201cIron supplements cure anemia\u201d is a belief that depends on knowing how hemoglobin works, knowing how digestion works, having observed iron supplements cure anemia\u2026lots of different kinds of evidence, at different scales of complexity, confirm the prediction. \n\u201cAntioxidants reduce cancer risk\u201d is an example of the kind of belief we should be skeptical about.  Free radical damage may lead to cancer; antioxidants stabilize free radicals; so one might think antioxidants prevent cancer. Some early clinical trials found that taking antioxidants reduced cancer risk; but further study found that they probably don\u2019t.  And there\u2019s some evidence that \u201cfree radicals\u201d (or reactive oxygen species) are the mechanism by which the immune system and chemotherapy drugs attack cancers, so antioxidants, if anything, protect cancer cells.  We don\u2019t have a clear model of what antioxidants do, in the same way that we have a clear model of what role iron plays in the blood, so we ought to be skeptical of any conclusions about \u201cantioxidants are good for you\u201d or \u201cantioxidants are bad for you.\u201d And we ought to be *especially* skeptical of anything that assumes a cause (eating antioxidants) will result in a health outcome (less cancer) merely because the cause affects an intermediate biochemical step (stabilizing free radicals).\nIf there\u2019s a prevailing theory in the biomedical sciences that a.) relies on complex chains of genetic and biochemical causation, and b.) hasn\u2019t shown measurable results in the form of lower death rates, then I\u2019m going to tag it as improbable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scott Alexander says: \n\n\t\t\tFebruary 17, 2013 at 8:31 pm \n1. I didn\u2019t mean to \u201caccuse\u201d you of saying this. I meant other, less reputable sources like Time Magazine and most of the rest of the media.\n2. I\u2019m not sure to what degree I agree with your emphasis on understanding mechanism. There are a lot of things that work in biology without us having any idea how. Natural selection was a pretty good example until we discovered genes. Another good example would be digitalis, which was used to treat heart failure since the 1700s but whose full mechanism of action was only discovered in the last few decades. I prefer good experimental results to good theoretical explanation, but the caveat which I think you\u2019re trying to point out is that they had better be *good* experimental results, as opposed to marginal experimental results.\n3. The last part wasn\u2019t meant as an attack on MetaMed, just on some of the people who try to talk about this on Less Wrong. I\u2019ve edited the post to try to make this slightly clearer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sarah says: \n\n\t\t\tFebruary 17, 2013 at 8:15 pm \nA defense of MetaMed:\n1.  We are not a Silicon Valley startup, we aren\u2019t even based in Silicon Valley, we don\u2019t belong to that culture, we\u2019re not a consumer web app, there\u2019s really no sense in which that\u2019s the right reference class.\n2.  We are only doing a major publicity launch at the end of this *month*, so name changes are not really a practical issue.  The name changes were in response to market research \u2014 people are bad at intuiting what kinds of names appeal to customers, and we finally settled on MetaMed after our marketing team put a lot of effort into finding out what made the best impression. It\u2019s just window dressing; the internal structure of the company has stayed the same.\n3.  It\u2019s useless to promise we can fix a hard problem until we succeed in fixing it.  But we\u2019re not claiming to be able to waltz in and fix medicine with no effort.  One of the main things we\u2019re doing is a bit more modest: just *assembling* a coherent model out of the research that already exists.  \nWe know, for example, that statistical prediction rules work very well for medical diagnosis and risk prediction; these are just simple little combinations of a few known risk factors for, say, heart attacks, that give each patient a score rating their hart attack risk.  But these rules only exist for a few special cases in medicine.  For most diseases, nobody has gone around combining all the risk factors and all the signs and symptoms into a single statistical model that says \u201cif we know X, Y, and Z about you, here\u2019s how likely you are to have disease A.\u201d \nOne way of looking at MetaMed\u2019s job is that we combine, reorganize, and quantify the existing scientific literature.  \nNow, in a sense, you could say that medical culture already does this; doctors pretty much know, from some combination of their clinical experience, their med school education, and whatever research they have time to read, how to diagnose diseases and choose treatments.  But this is, one has to admit, an imperfect process.  Human minds are very bad at intuitively putting disparate pieces of information together.  That\u2019s *why* things like checklists and statistical prediction rules can outperform clinicians; using intuitive judgment, you\u2019ll forget things.  Formally organizing the research literature into prediction models is a kind of safeguard on expert judgment, and I think it\u2019s quite likely to catch things doctors miss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deiseach says: \n\n\t\t\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 1:53 am \n(1) Statistics are much more complicated than people (even smart, educated, knowledgeable in their field people) think.\n(2) Medicine is an art more than a science.\n(3) Confusion reigns.  For family reasons, I\u2019ve been scouring online resources for information on diabetes diets, and I\u2019m getting confusing recommendations even on the very same website; e.g. carbohydrates increase blood sugar \u2013 well and good; starch as well as sugar needs to be watched \u2013 fine, tell me more; eat vegetables rather than fruit \u2013 okay, what vegetables; eat carrots, they\u2019re low-GI \u2013 no, don\u2019t eat carrots, they\u2019re loaded with sugar! Eat peas \u2013 no, don\u2019t eat peas, they\u2019re full of starch and starch is bad!\nThe conclusion I am left with is that the only safe diet (for anything) is rainwater and moss \ud83d\ude41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Michael vassar says: \n\n\t\t\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 10:06 am \nThis is exactly what MetaMed is for.   It\u2019s definitely the case that 1, 2, and 3 are true, but 1 is largely a consequence of accepting too low a standard when seeing people as smatt and knowledgeable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sniffnoy says: \n\n\t\t\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 2:22 am \nSo this suggests that if you see a large experimental study being trumpeted in the medical literature, the chance that it will be found to be totally false (as opposed to true but exaggerated) within ten years or so is only about 5% \u2013 which if you understand p-values is about what you should have believed already.\n(I think. This requires quite a few assumptions, not the least of which is that my calculations above are correct!)\nNot really.  P-values are not how likely something is to be wrong or invalid.  Rather, they\u2019re how likely this data was to show up if you were wrong, i.e., they\u2019re P(E | not H) rather than P(not H | E).  (Except they\u2019re not really that, either \u2014 they\u2019re just how likely this data was to show up if you were wrong in a particular way, i.e. the null hypothesis.)\nAnd yes this is very counterintuitive and hence why everybody gets them wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scott Alexander says: \n\n\t\t\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 1:03 pm \nThe 5% number comes not from p-values but from the empirical observation that of 40 studies analyzed, 2 were wrong. This matches the number of studies that would be wrong merely by chance if we only took the p-value into account rather than the base rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sniffnoy says: \n\n\t\t\tFebruary 19, 2013 at 5:58 am \nYes, but you say that the empirical 5% matches what you\u2019d expect from a p-value of 5%, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct.  Unless you just mean \u201chey look these numbers are the same!\u201d which doesn\u2019t really mean anything by itself.\nI mean, you talk about just taking the p-value into account rather than the base rate, but it\u2019s not at all clear to me that the way you do so is meaningful.  Just considering the equation P(H|E)=P(E|H)*P(H)\/P(E), you\u2019re suggesting that we \u201cdon\u2019t take into account base rate\u201d by assuming P(H)\/P(E) is about 1?  I really don\u2019t see what makes such an assumption reasonable.\nNow if you want to say, \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about what P(H) is, and so just assume P(H)\/P(E) is some constant\u201d, that might make more sense.  But then you can\u2019t get any particular number out of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Elissa says: \n\n\t\t\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 3:59 am \nThanks for looking into the 90% thing.

I still think \u201c80% of non-experimental studies\u201d is a pretty big caveat compared to \u201c80% of research\u201d but I have no idea how this was phrased and for all I know you said it that way.

This is the first part I think is kind of unfair.\nI disagree. Negative results don\u2019t show that an effect isn\u2019t there. They just show that it\u2019s too small to see with that sample size. A negative result being later disproven does not show a flaw in the original study.\nIf you show that the effect is there and is large enough that the first study shouldn\u2019t have missed it, that\u2019s a problem, but it makes this way more complicated so it\u2019s easier just to ignore those studies.\nThinking about this more, I guess they\u2019d have to do something like this either way, to show that the study didn\u2019t just fail to replicate because the second study had a false negative. Either they\u2019d have to look at ones where the study where it fails is much more powerful, or they\u2019d have to use a two-tailed T-test and show that the two studies shouldn\u2019t result from the same effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPingback: The Problem With Connection Theory | The Rationalist Conspiracy\n\n\n\n\n Q says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 28, 2014 at 4:10 pm \nHere is a 90% number: \u201cHe (Ioannidis) charges that as much as 90 percent of the published medical information that doctors rely on is flawed.\u201d\nhttp:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2010\/11\/lies-damned-lies-and-medical-science\/308269\/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta\n\nRegister Log in\nEntries feed\nComments feed\nWordPress.org\n\n\nB4X is a free and open source developer tool that allows users to write apps for Android, iOS, and more.\n80,000 Hours researches different problems and professions to help you figure out how to do as much good as possible.

When combined with computation, it gives rise to the area of convex optimization that has had a huge impact on understanding and improving the world we live in. However, convexity does not provide all the answers. Many procedures in statistics, machine learning and nature at large\u2014Bayesian inference, deep learning, protein folding\u2014successfully solve non-convex problems that are NP-hard, i.e., intractable on worst-case instances. Moreover, often nature or humans choose methods that are inefficient in the worst case to solve problems in P.\nCan we develop a theory to resolve this mismatch between reality and the predictions of worst-case analysis?  Such a theory could identify structure in natural inputs that helps sidestep worst-case complexity.\nThis blog is dedicated to the idea that optimization methods\u2014whether created by humans or nature, whether convex or nonconvex\u2014are exciting objects of study and, often lead to useful algorithms and insights into nature. This study can be seen as an extension of classical mathematical fields such as dynamical systems and differential equations among others, but with the important addition of the notion of computational efficiency.\nWe will report on interesting research directions and open problems, and highlight progress that has been made. We will write articles ourselves as well as encourage others to contribute. In doing so, we hope to generate an active dialog between theorists, scientists and practitioners and to motivate a generation of young researchers to work on these important problems.\nContributing an article\nIf you\u2019re writing an article for this blog, please follow these guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Theme available on Github.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"chosen":"\n\nAI Safety Fundamentals Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser doesn't support iframes\n    \n\n","rejected":"\n\n\n\nThe Control Group Is Out Of Control | Slate Star Codex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\nAbout \/ Top Posts\nArchives\nTop Posts\n\nComments Feed\nRSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\nSlate Star Codex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll \nEconomics\n\nArtir Kel\nBryan Caplan\nDavid Friedman\nPseudoerasmus\nScott Sumner\nTyler Cowen\n\n\nEffective Altruism\n\n80000 Hours Blog\nEffective Altruism Forum\nGiveWell Blog\n\n\nRationality\n\nAlyssa Vance\nBeeminder\nElizabeth Van Nostrand\nGwern Branwen\nJacob Falkovich\nJeff Kaufman\nKatja Grace\nKelsey Piper\nLess Wrong\nPaul Christiano\nRobin Hanson\nSarah Constantin\nZack Davis\nZvi Mowshowitz\n\n\nScience\n\nAndrew Gelman\nGreg Cochran\nMichael Caton\nRazib Khan\nScott Aaronson\nStephan Guyenet\nSteve Hsu\n\n\nSSC Elsewhere\n\nSSC Discord Server\nSSC Podcast\nSSC Subreddit\nUnsong\n\n\nArchives\n\nJanuary 2021\nSeptember 2020\nJune 2020\nMay 2020\nApril 2020\nMarch 2020\nFebruary 2020\nJanuary 2020\nDecember 2019\nNovember 2019\nOctober 2019\nSeptember 2019\nAugust 2019\nJuly 2019\nJune 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nMarch 2019\nFebruary 2019\nJanuary 2019\nDecember 2018\nNovember 2018\nOctober 2018\nSeptember 2018\nAugust 2018\nJuly 2018\nJune 2018\nMay 2018\nApril 2018\nMarch 2018\nFebruary 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nNovember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nAugust 2017\nJuly 2017\nJune 2017\nMay 2017\nApril 2017\nMarch 2017\nFebruary 2017\nJanuary 2017\nDecember 2016\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nAugust 2016\nJuly 2016\nJune 2016\nMay 2016\nApril 2016\nMarch 2016\nFebruary 2016\nJanuary 2016\nDecember 2015\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nAugust 2015\nJuly 2015\nJune 2015\nMay 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nJanuary 2015\nDecember 2014\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nAugust 2014\nJuly 2014\nJune 2014\nMay 2014\nApril 2014\nMarch 2014\nFebruary 2014\nJanuary 2014\nDecember 2013\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nSeptember 2013\nAugust 2013\nJuly 2013\nJune 2013\nMay 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\n\nFull Archives\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Control Group Is Out Of Control\n\nPosted on April 28, 2014 by Scott Alexander \n\nI.\nAllan Crossman calls parapsychology the control group for science.\nThat is, in let\u2019s say a drug testing experiment, you give some people the drug and they recover.

You\u2019d have to find a phenomenon that definitely doesn\u2019t exist, somehow convince a whole community of scientists across the world that it does, and fund them to study it for a couple of decades without them figuring it out.\nLuckily we have a natural experiment in terms of parapsychology \u2013 the study of psychic phenomena \u2013 which most reasonable people believe don\u2019t exist, but which a community of practicing scientists believes in and publishes papers on all the time.\nThe results are pretty dismal. Parapsychologists are able to produce experimental evidence for psychic phenomena about as easily as normal scientists are able to produce such evidence for normal, non-psychic phenomena. This suggests the existence of a very large \u201cplacebo effect\u201d in science \u2013 ie with enough energy focused on a subject, you can always produce \u201cexperimental evidence\u201d for it that meets the usual scientific standards. As Eliezer Yudkowsky puts it:\nParapsychologists are constantly protesting that they are playing by all the standard scientific rules, and yet their results are being ignored \u2013 that they are unfairly being held to higher standards than everyone else. I\u2019m willing to believe that. It just means that the standard statistical methods of science are so weak and flawed as to permit a field of study to sustain itself in the complete absence of any subject matter.\nThese sorts of thoughts have become more common lately in different fields. Psychologists admit to a crisis of replication as some of their most interesting findings turn out to be spurious. And in medicine, John Ioannides and others have been criticizing the research for a decade now and telling everyone they need to up their standards.\n\u201cUp your standards\u201d has been a complicated demand that cashes out in a lot of technical ways. But there is broad agreement among the most intelligent voices I read (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) about a couple of promising directions we could go:\n1. Demand very large sample size.\n2. Demand replication, preferably exact replication, most preferably multiple exact replications.\n3. Trust systematic reviews and meta-analyses rather than individual studies. Meta-analyses must prove homogeneity of the studies they analyze.\n4. Use Bayesian rather than frequentist analysis, or even combine both techniques.\n5. Stricter p-value criteria. It is far too easy to massage p-values to get less than 0.05. Also, make meta-analyses look for \u201cp-hacking\u201d by examining the distribution of p-values in the included studies.\n6. Require pre-registration of trials.\n7. Address publication bias by searching for unpublished trials, displaying funnel plots, and using statistics like \u201cfail-safe N\u201d to investigate the possibility of suppressed research.\n8. Do heterogeneity analyses or at least observe and account for differences in the studies you analyze.\n9. Demand randomized controlled trials. None of this \u201ccorrelated even after we adjust for confounders\u201d BS.\n10. Stricter effect size criteria. It\u2019s easy to get small effect sizes in anything.\nIf we follow these ten commandments, then we avoid the problems that allowed parapsychology and probably a whole host of other problems we don\u2019t know about to sneak past the scientific gatekeepers.\nWell, what now, motherfuckers?\nII.\nBem, Tressoldi, Rabeyron, and Duggan (2014), full text available for download at the top bar of the link above, is parapsychology\u2019s way of saying \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d to the idea of a more rigorous scientific paradigm making them quietly wither away.\nYou might remember Bem as the prestigious establishment psychologist who decided to try his hand at parapsychology and to his and everyone else\u2019s surprise got positive results. Everyone had a lot of criticisms, some of which were very very good, and the study failed replication several times. Case closed, right?\nEarlier this month Bem came back with a meta-analysis of ninety replications from tens of thousands of participants in thirty three laboratories in fourteen countries confirming his original finding, p < 1.2 * -1010, Bayes factor 7.4 * 109, funnel plot beautifully symmetrical, p-hacking curve nice and right-skewed, Orwin fail-safe n of 559, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\nBy my count, Bem follows all of the commandments except [6] and [10]. He apologizes for not using pre-registration, but says it\u2019s okay because the studies were exact replications of a previous study that makes it impossible for an unsavory researcher to change the parameters halfway through and does pretty much the same thing. And he apologizes for the small effect size but points out that some effect sizes are legitimately very small, this is no smaller than a lot of other commonly-accepted results, and that a high enough p-value ought to make up for a low effect size.\nThis is far better than the average meta-analysis. Bem has always been pretty careful and this is no exception. Yet its conclusion is that psychic powers exist.\nSo \u2013 once again \u2013 what now, motherfuckers?\nIII.\nIn retrospect, that list of ways to fix science above was a little optimistic.\nThe first nine items (large sample sizes, replications, low p-values, Bayesian statistics, meta-analysis, pre-registration, publication bias, heterogeneity) all try to solve the same problem: accidentally mistaking noise in the data for a signal.\nWe\u2019ve placed so much emphasis on not mistaking noise for signal that when someone like Bem hands us a beautiful, perfectly clear signal on a silver platter, it briefly stuns us. \u201cWow, of the three hundred different terrible ways to mistake noise for signal, Bem has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt he hasn\u2019t done any of them.\u201d And we get so stunned we\u2019re likely to forget that this is only part of the battle.\nBem definitely picked up a signal. The only question is whether it\u2019s a signal of psi, or a signal of poor experimental technique.\nNone of these commandments even touch poor experimental technique \u2013 or confounding, or whatever you want to call it. If an experiment is confounded, if it produces a strong signal even when its experimental hypothesis is true, then using a larger sample size will just make that signal even stronger. \nReplicating it will just reproduce the confounded results again. \nLow p-values will be easy to get if you perform the confounded experiment on a large enough scale.\nMeta-analyses of confounded studies will obey the immortal law of \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d.\nPre-registration only assures that your study will not get any worse than it was the first time you thought of it, which may be very bad indeed.\nSearching for publication bias only means you will get all of the confounded studies, instead of just some of them.\nHeterogeneity just tells you whether all of the studies were confounded about the same amount. \nBayesian statistics, alone among these first eight, ought to be able to help with this problem. After all, a good Bayesian should be able to say \u201cWell, I got some impressive results, but my prior for psi is very low, so this raises my belief in psi slightly, but raises my belief that the experiments were confounded a lot.\u201d\nUnfortunately, good Bayesians are hard to come by, and the researchers here seem to be making some serious mistakes. Here\u2019s Bem:\nAn opportunity to calculate an approximate answer to this question emerges from a Bayesian critique of Bem\u2019s (2011) experiments by Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, & van der Maas (2011). Although Wagenmakers et al. did not explicitly claim psi to be impossible, they came very close by setting their prior odds at 10^20 against the psi hypothesis. The Bayes Factor for our full database is approximately 10^9 in favor of the psi hypothesis (Table 1), which implies that our meta-analysis should lower their posterior odds against the psi hypothesis to 10^11\nLet me shame both participants in this debate.\nBem, you are abusing Bayes factor. If Wagenmakers uses your 10^9 Bayes factor to adjust from his prior of 10^-20 to 10^-11, then what happens the next time you come up with another database of studies supporting your hypothesis? We all know you will, because you\u2019ve amply proven these results weren\u2019t due to chance, so whatever factor produced these results \u2013 whether real psi or poor experimental technique \u2013 will no doubt keep producing them for the next hundred replication attempts. When those come in, does Wagenmakers have to adjust his probability from 10^-11 to 10^-2? When you get another hundred studies, does he have to go from 10^-2 to 10^7? If so, then by conservation of expected evidence he should just update to 10^+7 right now \u2013 or really to infinity, since you can keep coming up with more studies till the cows come home. But in fact he shouldn\u2019t do that, because at some point his thought process becomes \u201cOkay, I already know that studies of this quality can consistently produce positive findings, so either psi is real or studies of this quality aren\u2019t good enough to disprove it\u201d. This point should probably happen well before he increases his probability by a factor of 10^9. See Confidence Levels Inside And Outside An Argument for this argument made in greater detail.\nWagenmakers, you are overconfident. Suppose God came down from Heaven and said in a booming voice \u201cEVERY SINGLE STUDY IN THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED PERFECTLY WITHOUT FLAWS OR BIAS, AS WAS THE META-ANALYSIS ITSELF.\u201d You would see a p-value of less than 1.2 * 10^-10 and think \u201cI bet that was just coincidence\u201d? And then they could do another study of the same size, also God-certified, returning exactly the same results, and you would say \u201cI bet that was just coincidence too\u201d? YOU ARE NOT THAT CERTAIN OF ANYTHING. Seriously, read the @#!$ing Sequences.\nBayesian statistics, at least the way they are done here, aren\u2019t gong to be of much use to anybody.\nThat leaves randomized controlled trials and effect sizes.\nRandomized controlled trials are great. They eliminate most possible confounders in one fell swoop, and are excellent at keeping experimenters honest. Unfortunately, most of the studies in the Bem meta-analysis were already randomized controlled trials.\nHigh effect sizes are really the only thing the Bem study lacks. And it is very hard to experimental technique so bad that it consistently produces a result with a high effect size.\nBut as Bem points out, demanding high effect size limits our ability to detect real but low-effect phenomena. Just to give an example, many physics experiments \u2013 like the ones that detected the Higgs boson or neutrinos \u2013 rely on detecting extremely small perturbations in the natural order, over millions of different trials. Less esoterically, Bem mentions the example of aspirin decreasing heart attack risk, which it definitely does and which is very important, but which has an effect size lower than that of his psi results. If humans have some kind of very weak psionic faculty that under regular conditions operates poorly and inconsistently, but does indeed exist, then excluding it by definition from the realm of things science can discover would be a bad idea.\nAll of these techniques are about reducing the chance of confusing noise for signal. But when we think of them as the be-all and end-all of scientific legitimacy, we end up in awkward situations where they come out super-confident in a study\u2019s accuracy simply because the issue was one they weren\u2019t geared up to detect. Because a lot of the time the problem is something more than just noise.\nIV.\nWiseman & Schlitz\u2019s Experimenter Effects And The Remote Detection Of Staring is my favorite parapsychology paper ever and sends me into fits of nervous laughter every time I read it.\nThe backstory: there is a classic parapsychological experiment where a subject is placed in a room alone, hooked up to a video link. At random times, an experimenter stares at them menacingly through the video link. The hypothesis is that this causes their galvanic skin response (a physiological measure of subconscious anxiety) to increase, even though there is no non-psychic way the subject could know whether the experimenter was staring or not. \nSchiltz is a psi believer whose staring experiments had consistently supported the presence of a psychic phenomenon. Wiseman, in accordance with nominative determinism is a psi skeptic whose staring experiments keep showing nothing and disproving psi. Since they were apparently the only two people in all of parapsychology with a smidgen of curiosity or rationalist virtue, they decided to team up and figure out why they kept getting such different results.\nThe idea was to plan an experiment together, with both of them agreeing on every single tiny detail. They would then go to a laboratory and set it up, again both keeping close eyes on one another. Finally, they would conduct the experiment in a series of different batches. Half the batches (randomly assigned) would be conducted by Dr. Schlitz, the other half by Dr. Wiseman. Because the two authors had very carefully standardized the setting, apparatus and procedure beforehand, \u201cconducted by\u201d pretty much just meant greeting the participants, giving the experimental instructions, and doing the staring.\nThe results? Schlitz\u2019s trials found strong evidence of psychic powers, Wiseman\u2019s trials found no evidence whatsoever.\nTake a second to reflect on how this makes no sense. Two experimenters in the same laboratory, using the same apparatus, having no contact with the subjects except to introduce themselves and flip a few switches \u2013 and whether one or the other was there that day completely altered the result. For a good time, watch the gymnastics they have to do to in the paper to make this sound sufficiently sensical to even get published. This is the only journal article I\u2019ve ever read where, in the part of the Discussion section where you\u2019re supposed to propose possible reasons for your findings, both authors suggest maybe their co-author hacked into the computer and altered the results.\nWhile it\u2019s nice to see people exploring Bem\u2019s findings further, this is the experiment people should be replicating ninety times. I expect something would turn up. \nAs it is, Kennedy and Taddonio list ten similar studies with similar results. One cannot help wondering about publication bias (if the skeptic and the believer got similar results, who cares?). But the phenomenon is sufficiently well known in parapsychology that it has led to its own host of theories about how skeptics emit negative auras, or the enthusiasm of a proponent is a necessary kindling for psychic powers.\nOther fields don\u2019t have this excuse. In psychotherapy, for example, practically the only consistent finding is that whatever kind of psychotherapy the person running the study likes is most effective. Thirty different meta-analyses on the subject have confirmed this with strong effect size (d = 0.54) and good significance (p = .001).\nThen there\u2019s Munder (2013), which is a meta-meta-analysis on whether meta-analyses of confounding by researcher allegiance effect were themselves meta-confounded by meta-researcher allegiance effect. He found that indeed, meta-researchers who believed in researcher allegiance effect were more likely to turn up positive results in their studies of researcher allegiance effect (p < .002). \n\nIt gets worse. There's a famous story about an experiment where a scientist told teachers that his advanced psychometric methods had predicted a couple of kids in their class were about to become geniuses (the students were actually chosen at random). He followed the students for the year and found that their intelligence actually increased. This was supposed to be a Cautionary Tale About How Teachers\u2019 Preconceptions Can Affect Children.\nLess famous is that the same guy did the same thing with rats. He sent one laboratory a box of rats saying they were specially bred to be ultra-intelligent, and another lab a box of (identical) rats saying they were specially bred to be slow and dumb. Then he had them do standard rat learning tasks, and sure enough the first lab found very impressive results, the second lab very disappointing ones.\nThis scientist \u2013 let\u2019s give his name, Robert Rosenthal \u2013 then investigated three hundred forty five different studies for evidence of the same phenomenon. He found effect sizes of anywhere from 0.15 to 1.7, depending on the type of experiment involved. Note that this could also be phrased as \u201cbetween twice as strong and twenty times as strong as Bem\u2019s psi effect\u201d. Mysteriously, animal learning experiments displayed the highest effect size, supporting the folk belief that animals are hypersensitive to subtle emotional cues.\nOkay, fine. Subtle emotional cues. That\u2019s way more scientific than saying \u201cnegative auras\u201d. But the question remains \u2013 what went wrong for Schlitz and Wiseman? Even if Schlitz had done everything short of saying \u201cThe hypothesis of this experiment is for your skin response to increase when you are being stared at, please increase your skin response at that time,\u201d and subjects had tried to comply, the whole point was that they didn\u2019t know when they were being stared at, because to find that out you\u2019d have to be psychic. And how are these rats figuring out what the experimenters\u2019 subtle emotional cues mean anyway? I can\u2019t figure out people\u2019s subtle emotional cues half the time!\nI know that standard practice here is to tell the story of Clever Hans and then say That Is Why We Do Double-Blind Studies. But first of all, I\u2019m pretty sure no one does double-blind studies with rats. Second of all, I think most social psych studies aren\u2019t double blind \u2013 I just checked the first one I thought of, Aronson and Steele on stereotype threat, and it certainly wasn\u2019t. Third of all, this effect seems to be just as common in cases where it\u2019s hard to imagine how the researchers\u2019 subtle emotional cues could make a difference. Like Schlitz and Wiseman. Or like the psychotherapy experiments, where most of the subjects were doing therapy with individual psychologists and never even saw whatever prestigious professor was running the study behind the scenes.\nI think it\u2019s a combination of subconscious emotional cues, subconscious statistical trickery, perfectly conscious fraud which for all we know happens much more often than detected, and things we haven\u2019t discovered yet which are at least as weird as subconscious emotional cues. But rather than speculate, I prefer to take it as a brute fact. Studies are going to be confounded by the allegiance of the researcher. When researchers who don\u2019t believe something discover it, that\u2019s when it\u2019s worth looking into.\nV.\nSo what exactly happened to Bem?\nAlthough Bem looked hard to find unpublished material, I don\u2019t know if he succeeded. Unpublished material, in this context, has to mean \u201cmaterial published enough for Bem to find it\u201d, which in this case was mostly things presented at conferences. What about results so boring that they were never even mentioned?\nAnd I predict people who believe in parapsychology are more likely to conduct parapsychology experiments than skeptics. Suppose this is true. And further suppose that for some reason, experimenter effect is real and powerful. That means most of the experiments conducted will support Bem\u2019s result. But this is still a weird form of \u201cpublication bias\u201d insofar as it ignores the contrary results of hypotheticaly experiments that were never conducted.\nAnd worst of all, maybe Bem really did do an excellent job of finding every little two-bit experiment that no journal would take. How much can we trust these non-peer-reviewed procedures?\nI looked through his list of ninety studies for all the ones that were both exact replications and had been peer-reviewed (with one caveat to be mentioned later). I found only seven:\nBatthyany, Kranz, and Erber: .268\nRitchie 1: 0.015\nRitchie 2: -0.219\nRichie 3: -0.040\nSubbotsky 1: 0.279\nSubbotsky 2: 0.292\nSubbotsky 3: -.399\nThree find large positive effects, two find approximate zero effects, and two find large negative effects. Without doing any calculatin\u2019, this seems pretty darned close to chance for me.\nOkay, back to that caveat about replications. One of Bem\u2019s strongest points was how many of the studies included were exact replications of his work. This is important because if you do your own novel experiment, it leaves a lot of wiggle room to keep changing the parameters and statistics a bunch of times until you get the effect you want. This is why lots of people want experiments to be preregistered with specific committments about what you\u2019re going to test and how you\u2019re going to do it. These experiments weren\u2019t preregistered, but conforming to a previously done experiment is a pretty good alternative.\nExcept that I think the criteria for \u201creplication\u201d here were exceptionally loose. For example, Savva et al was listed as an \u201cexact replication\u201d of Bem, but it was performed in 2004 \u2013 seven years before Bem\u2019s original study took place. I know Bem believes in precognition, but that\u2019s going too far. As far as I can tell \u201cexact replication\u201d here means \u201ckinda similar psionic-y thing\u201d. Also, Bem classily lists his own experiments as exact replications of themselves, which gives a big boost to the \u201cexact replications return the same results as Bem\u2019s original studies\u201d line. I would want to see much stricter criteria for replication before I relax the \u201cpreregister your trials\u201d requirement.\n(Richard Wiseman \u2013 the same guy who provided the negative aura for the Wiseman and Schiltz experiment \u2013 has started a pre-register site for Bem replications. He says he has received five of them. This is very promising. There is also a separate pre-register for parapsychology trials in general. I am both extremely pleased at this victory for good science, and ashamed that my own field is apparently behind parapsychology in the \u201cscientific rigor\u201d department)\nThat is my best guess at what happened here \u2013 a bunch of poor-quality, peer-unreviewed studies that weren\u2019t as exact replications as we would like to believe, all subject to mysterious experimenter effects.\nThis is not a criticism of Bem or a criticism of parapsychology. It\u2019s something that is inherent to the practice of meta-analysis, and even more, inherent to the practice of science. Other than a few very exceptional large medical trials, there is not a study in the world that would survive the level of criticism I am throwing at Bem right now.\nI think Bem is wrong. The level of criticism it would take to prove a wrong study wrong is higher than that almost any existing study can withstand. That is not encouraging for existing studies.\nVI.\nThe motto of the Royal Society \u2013 Hooke, Boyle, Newton, some of the people who arguably invented modern science \u2013 was nullus in verba, \u201ctake no one\u2019s word\u201d.\nThis was a proper battle cry for seventeenth century scientists. Think about the (admittedly kind of mythologized) history of Science. The scholastics saying that matter was this, or that, and justifying themselves by long treatises about how based on A, B, C, the word of the Bible, Aristotle, self-evident first principles, and the Great Chain of Being all clearly proved their point. Then other scholastics would write different long treatises on how D, E, and F, Plato, St. Augustine, and the proper ordering of angels all indicated that clearly matter was something different. Both groups were pretty sure that the other had make a subtle error of reasoning somewhere, and both groups were perfectly happy to spend centuries debating exactly which one of them it was.\nAnd then Galileo said \u201cWait a second, instead of debating exactly how objects fall, let\u2019s just drop objects off of something really tall and see what happens\u201d, and after that, Science.\nYes, it\u2019s kind of mythologized. But like all myths, it contains a core of truth. People are terrible. If you let people debate things, they will do it forever, come up with horrible ideas, get them entrenched, play politics with them, and finally reach the point where they\u2019re coming up with theories why people who disagree with them are probably secretly in the pay of the Devil. \nImagine having to conduct the global warming debate, except that you couldn\u2019t appeal to scientific consensus and statistics because scientific consensus and statistics hadn\u2019t been invented yet. In a world without science, everything would be like that.\nHeck, just look at philosophy.\nThis is the principle behind the Pyramid of Scientific Evidence. The lowest level is your personal opinions, no matter how ironclad you think the logic behind them is. Just above that is expert opinion, because no matter how expert someone is they\u2019re still only human. Above that is anecdotal evidence and case studies, because even though you\u2019re finally getting out of people\u2019s heads, it\u2019s still possible for the content of people\u2019s heads to influence which cases they pay attention to. At each level, we distill away more and more of the human element, until presumably at the top the dross of humanity has been purged away entirely and we end up with pure unadulterated reality.\n\nThe Pyramid of Scientific Evidence\nAnd for a while this went well. People would drop things off towers, or see how quickly gases expanded, or observe chimpanzees, or whatever.\nThen things started getting more complicated. People started investigating more subtle effects, or effects that shifted with the observer. The scientific community became bigger, everyone didn\u2019t know everyone anymore, you needed more journals to find out what other people had done. Statistics became more complicated, allowing the study of noisier data but also bringing more peril. And a lot of science done by smart and honest people ended up being wrong, and we needed to figure out exactly which science that was.\nAnd the result is a lot of essays like this one, where people who think they\u2019re smart take one side of a scientific \u201ccontroversy\u201d and say which studies you should believe. And then other people take the other side and tell you why you should believe different studies than the first person thought you should believe. And there is much argument and many insults and citing of authorities and interminable debate for, if not centuries, at least a pretty long time.\nThe highest level of the Pyramid of Scientific Evidence is meta-analysis. But a lot of meta-analyses are crap. This meta-analysis got p < 1.2 * 10^-10 for a conclusion I'm pretty sure is false, and it isn\u2019t even one of the crap ones. Crap meta-analyses look more like this, or even worse. \nHow do I know it\u2019s crap? Well, I use my personal judgment. How do I know my personal judgment is right? Well, a smart well-credentialed person like James Coyne agrees with me. How do I know James Coyne is smart? I can think of lots of cases where he\u2019s been right before. How do I know those count? Well, John Ioannides has published a lot of studies analyzing the problems with science, and confirmed that cases like the ones Coyne talks about are pretty common. Why can I believe Ioannides\u2019 studies? Well, there have been good meta-analyses of them. But how do I know if those meta-analyses are crap or not? Well\u2026\n\nThe Ouroboros of Scientific Evidence\nScience! YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE! It was said that you would destroy reliance on biased experts, not join them!

And I really mean that 100%. We are clearly performing dramatic modifications to our climate and we\u2019re clearly doing so at a faster rate than previous species.\nSo back to \u201cglobal warming\u201d\u2026 what if it\u2019s really \u201cglobal cooling\u201d? Does it actually matter? I mean, what if it was \u201cglobal cooling\u201d, would we start burning down forests en masse just to \u201cfix\u201d the problem?\nAll of this debate back and forth is just ignoring the real problem: the planet is changing, how do we want to adapt, how do we want to mold it?\nI mean, we want to slow CO2 emissions because they also contain lots of things that unhealthy for us to breathe.

It matters whether or not CO2 warms or cools the planet.\nFirst, we would need to pursue different policies in response to each possibility because they involve different scenarios for danger. Global warming might be stoppable by throwing giant ice cubes into the ocean, but if there\u2019s global cooling that\u2019s the last thing we should do. Second, they would have different consequences. Maybe warming would kill one billion people while cooling would only kill one million.\nIf CO2 is causing cooling and cooling is bad, we should want more trees and not fewer. Cooling is the opposite of warming but that doesn\u2019t imply that the opposite of one problem\u2019s solution will solve the other.\nPolicies aren\u2019t determined in a vacuum. If the only harmful consequence of CO2 is its effects on our lungs, it might not be a good to switch to other types of energy because the downsides might outweigh the upsides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gates VP says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 4:07 pm \nIf CO2 is causing cooling and cooling is bad\u2026\nThis is the core issue.

If those effects of those bombs do not count as \u201cclimate change\u201d for that region, then we need to be very specific about how we\u2019re going to define \u201cclimate change\u201d and attempt to measure the \u201cman-made\u201d effects thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ellie Kesselman says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 4, 2014 at 12:29 am \nGates, you said,\nWe are clearly performing dramatic modifications to our climate and\u2026doing so at a faster rate than previous species.

At the very least, it makes sense to conserve non-renewable resources because we\u2019ve nearly depleted them. Agreement and action on some basics like that would help. So would some honesty about carbon credit schemes (neoliberal economics is too easy to game) and boondoggle solar tax credits\/government funds that corrupt Green types have used for personal enrichment, repeatedly.\nYour comment didn\u2019t deserve to be called \u201cone of the worst ever seen on this website\u201d!

I see little reason to believe this premise.  For instance,  I would not be very surprised if gullibility or carelessness is correlated with belief in psychic powers, and willingness to do psychic experiments is also correlated with belief in psychic powers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scott Alexander says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 28, 2014 at 9:57 pm \nI doubt psychic researchers are just as good as normal researchers (though a few are) and I agree that if I meant \u201ccontrol group\u201d literally, in terms of trying to find the quantitative effect size of science, this methodology wouldn\u2019t be good enough.\nI\u2019m using control group more as a metaphor, where the mistakes of the best parapsychologists can be used as a pointer to figure out what other scientists have to improve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ken Arromdee says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 4:38 pm \nBut once you concede that psychic researchers aren\u2019t really like ordinary researchers , you have little reason to believe that psychic researchers will make the same sorts of mistakes that ordinary researchers do.  Even if you find single examples of both types making the same mistake, you have no reason to believe that the distribution is the same among both groups.  It could be that a mistake that is common among psychic researchers is rare among normal ones, and focusing on it is misplaced.\nI\u2019m also generally skeptical about using X as a metaphor when X is not actually true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 5, 2014 at 4:59 am \nWith respect, I provided in my atrociously long reply a series of arguments, with evidence, that parapsychologists are at least as good as mainstream researchers in most respects, and significantly better in others. Skeptics like Chris French concur with me; see his recent talk (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ObXWLF6acuw) for evidence of this.\nMosseau (2003), for example, took an empirical approach to this, and compared research in top parapsychology journals like the Journal of Scientific Exploration and the Journal of Parapsychology with mainstream journals such as the Journal of Molecular and Optical Physics, the British Journal of Psychology, etc, finding that, most of the time, fringe research displayed a higher level of conformance to several basic criteria of good science. This includes the reporting of negative results, usage of statistics, rejection of anecdotal evidence, self-correction, overlap with other fields of research, and abstinence from jargon. While I\u2019m aware most of these don\u2019t directly impact quality of experimentation, they do provide respectable evidence that parapsychologists are actually about as careful, in their scientific thinking, as most anyone else.\nMoreover, research trying to establish a link between  belief in psi phenomena and measures like IQ and credulity has been for the most part unsuccessful, finding that belief in psi does not vary according to level of education (although belief in superstitions like the power of 13 does).\nFinally, there is the fact that skeptics have directly involved themselves in the critique and even design of parapsychological studies. Ganzfeld studies after 1986, for example, owe much of their sophistication and rigor to Ray Hyman, who coauthored a report called the Joint Communique with Honorton, a parapsychologist, where a series of recommendations were specified whose implementation would be convincing, and have been widely adopted today.\nI discuss many more examples of sophistication in parapsychological research; see, again, my absurdly large post for these details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sniffnoy says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 28, 2014 at 10:11 pm \nSome nitpicking:\nWhen you talk about probabilities of 10^7 and such, obviously, this should be odds ratios.

(Rest of paragraph similarly.)\nOther fields don\u2019t have this excuse.

I\u2019ll be happy to start the discussion by suggesting that step 1 is to convert all the studies into likelihood functions on the same hypothesis space, and step 2 is to realize that the combined likelihood functions rule out all of the hypothesis space, and step 3 is to suggest which clusters of the hypothesis space are well-supported by many studies and to mark which other studies must then have been completely wrong.\nUntil that time, meta-analyses will go on being bullshit.  They are not the highest level of the scientific pyramid.  They can deliver whatever answer the analyst likes.  When I read about a new meta-analysis I mostly roll my eyes.  Maybe it was honest, sure, but how would I know?  And why would it give the right answer even if the researchers were in fact honest?  You can\u2019t multiply a bunch of likelihood functions and get what a real Bayesian would consider zero everywhere, and from this extract a verdict by the dark magic of frequentist statistics.\nI can envision what a real, epistemologically lawful, real-world respecting, probability-theory-obeying meta-analysis would look like.  I mean I couldn\u2019t tell you how to actually set down a method that everyone could follow, I don\u2019t have enough experience with how motivated reasoning plays out in these things and what pragmatic safeguards would be needed to stop it.

It used to be that science was \u201cdo an experiment to figure out how the world works\u201d rather than \u201cdecide everything in the world is fire then do an experiment to see if that\u2019s true\u201d. The latter is still better than deciding everything in the world is fire and not bothering with experiment, but it injects a lot of friction, especially into exploratory work.\nA slightly modified version of your proposal might separate reaching conclusions from proving them.  You wouldn\u2019t outsource your experimentation, you\u2019d still do your own experiments. But their results would be considered preliminary, and you\u2019d need to have your results replicated by a replication lab in order to be stamped as official science and published in the serious portions of serious journals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Josh H says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 12:46 pm \nYeah, I think that\u2019s a much better way of putting it.

What they don\u2019t know how to do is systemically prevent experimenter bias from systemically warping the design of and statistical interpretation of such experiments, leading to continual production of false positives.  \nIf we can set up incentives such that the experimenter\u2019s bias is orthogonal to the hypothesis being true or false, we would still expect some false negatives and false positives, since science is hard, but we\u2019d expect them to statistically average out over time instead of accumulating as entire disciplines worth of non-results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kevin C says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 12:45 am \nstep 1 is to convert all the studies into likelihood functions on the same hypothesis space\nWhile I agree that if the procedure you propose were possible it would be helpful, I\u2019m skeptical that step 1 is possible* outside the hardest of sciences. Sure, in physics, math, computer science, and maybe chemistry you can define the hypothesis space clearly. However, once you go even as far as molecular biology ex vivo, the hypothesis space becomes too difficult to measure, much less convert the original English & jargon description of the hypothesis into a proper representation of the hypothesis space. (Some in vitro biology may still be measurable, but as soon as you\u2019re dealing with even the simplest living cells, you\u2019ve got hundreds of proteins that have to be part of the hypothesis space, even if the hypothesis on that dimension is merely \u201cprotein X\u201d may be present but has neutral effect on the measured outcomes.)\n* That is, not possible for modern day humans. I\u2019m agnostic on whether even a super-human AI could correctly represent the hypothesis space of a molecular biology paper. I think you get into encoding issues before you get to hypotheses that complex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Douglas Knight says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 28, 2014 at 10:43 pm \nThere is another way to do placebo science \u2013 subtly sabotage the researcher\u2019s experiment. This is routinely done to all real science students (ie, physics majors at maybe 20 schools).\nThree find large positive effects, two find approximate zero effects, and two find large negative effects. Without doing any calculatin\u2019, this seems pretty darned close to chance for me.\nThe effects of chance assuming the null hypothesis are much more specific than the average effect being zero. If your sample sizes are adequate, there should be no large effects, by definition of \u201cadequate.\u201d\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\nAn analogy occurred to me, comparing the pyramid of evidence to Lewis Thomas\u2019s take on medicine. His \u201cTechnology of Medicine\u201d said that real medicine requires understanding and allows cheap immediate cures. In contrast, most real-world medicine is expensive use of techniques that barely work and do so for no apparent reason. The pyramid of evidence is purely a product of medicine, attempting to evaluate treatments that have tiny effect sizes. With no understanding, the only evaluation method is large samples. But it is not merely a tool for fake medicine, it is an example of fake science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Douglas Knight says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 28, 2014 at 11:14 pm \nI corrected my citation from Lewis Thomas\u2019s Youngest Science to an essay in his Lives of a Cell.

The only question is whether it\u2019s a signal of psi, or a signal of poor experimental technique.\nBut as Bem points out, demanding high effect size limits our ability to detect real but low-effect phenomena. Just to give an example, many physics experiments \u2013 like the ones that detected the Higgs boson or neutrinos \u2013 rely on detecting extremely small perturbations in the natural order, over millions of different trials.\nThe point I\u2019m about to mention, suggested by these two excerpts, is mostly covered in the Experimenter Effect section, but in a way that seems somewhat indirect to me. That point is systematic uncertainty. Particle physics experiments can confidently capture small effects because \u2013 in addition to commandments 1, 2, 4, 5, among others \u2013 we spend a great deal of time measuring biases in our detectors. Time spent assessing systematic uncertainty can easily make up the majority of a data analysis project. The failure to find (and correct or mitigate, if possible) systematic biases can give us results like faster-than-light neutrinos.\nOf course, it is much easier to give this advice than to take it and apply it to messy things like medicine or psychology. I freely admit that I would barely know where to start when it comes to such fields. Systematic uncertainty is an important topic in this type of discussion, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Chris Hallquist says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 28, 2014 at 11:50 pm \nCan anyone think of a remotely sensible explanation for the Wiseman and Schlitz result?

Thus most participants were assigned to experimenters in an opportunistic, rather than properly \u2018randomised\u2019 (e.g., via random number tables or the output of an RNG), way.\nSomething really weird could have happened there, but I have no idea what bias could have been added by that that would produce those results.\nIt\u2019s probably the RNG\u2019s sense of humor.

If the effect is not *very* large and the results *very* unequivocal, you probably either have an illusory result or an artifact of misunderstood structure (A appears to *sometimes* cause B if A is really two things, A1 and A2, and only A2 causes B.)\n*Physical plausibility. You don\u2019t believe in psi because it violates physics. You also shouldn\u2019t believe that drugs that don\u2019t cross the blood-brain barrier can have effects on the brain.  \n*Analogy.  If people have been finding MS \u201ccures\u201d for decades, the next MS cure isn\u2019t so credible.\n*Multiple independent lines of reasoning. Evolutionary, biochemical, and physiological arguments pointing in the same direction.  Especially simple arguments that are hard to screw up.\n*Motivation. Cui Bono. Yes, we care who funded it.\nI think what we\u2019re finding is that *blind* science, automatable science, \u201cstudies say X and this quickly-checkable rubric confirms the studies are good\u201d, isn\u2019t a good filter. \nTo be fair, rubrics could stand a lot of improvement.  (Cochrane, btw, *does* pay a lot of attention to experimental design.)  I do think an ideal meta-analysis could do a lot better than the average meta-analysis.\nBut the purpose of methodology is to abstract away personal opinion. We don\u2019t do this *just* to better approach truth. We also do it to avoid getting in fights.  We want to be able to claim to be impersonal, to be following a documented set of rules.  In an era where the volume of science is such that all metrics will be gamed and cargo-culted, methodology may just not be enough.  Old-fashioned, pre-modern heuristics like \u201cis this an honest man?\u201d and \u201cdoes this make sense?\u201d are unreliable, to be sure, but they\u2019re unreliable in a different way than statistics and procedures, and it may be time to consider their value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Michael Edward Vassar says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 29, 2014 at 1:50 pm \nThe hardcore take on funding bias is to just consider any study unworthy of consideration if it was funded *at all*.

Here are some potential expenses: researcher salary, subject compensation, equipment.\nI can see how you do science with no researcher salary, if the researchers themselves are independently wealthy* or have the necessary free time, and I can see uncompensated subjects participating for the fun or to promote knowledge. But building all your equipment (e.g. particle accelerators or microscopes) from scratch, no buying of any components, not harnessing specialization and trade? \u2018You nuts?\n* That would make science a hobby of the aristocracy, just like in the Good Old Reactionary Days (I\u2019m not a (neo-)reactionary).\nSomething I would expect from a Normal Person\u2014you know, the kind who mostly doesn\u2019t comment on blogs like this one\u2014would be to at least allow self-funding, i.e. allowing the aristocrats and hobbyists to buy their own equipment. Maybe what you meant was to taboo funding other than through The Right Channel, which is what? Government subsidies to basic science? But why is government agenda less distorting than other agendas? Okay, suppose it isn\u2019t and gives the individual researchers free reign; why is their agendas less distorting?\nIf your goal is for agenda influences to all wash out and simply fund people who (in aggregate) do Pure Truth-Seeking Science, it\u2019s not clear that self-funding or un-funding or government-funding or government-plus-private-funding is the right (or wrong) way to achieve that effect.\nComments?

Study A has a sample size of 100 and the p-value to reject H_0 is 0.04. Study B has a sample size of 1000 and the p-value to reject H_0 ist 0.04.\nQuestion: What\u2019s the difference in the probability to falsely reject the H_0 between the two studies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 4, 2014 at 9:46 pm \nThere is no difference. P(i \u2264 \u03b1| H0), where \u201c\u03b1\u201d is any threshold (e.g. 0.05) and i is the p-value of a study, does not depend upon sample size, n. There\u2019s nothing particularly surprising about this, though, IMO; people often think there is because they mix it up with P(i \u2264 \u03b1| Ha), or power, which increases as n increases.\nThe second study had only a larger sample size; given the same p-value, then, this logically implies it had a much smaller effect size. The converse is true: the first study had a much larger effect size, which made up for its small sample size. The result was the same p-value.\nIF there\u2019s a real effect, the p-value of a study should asymptotically converge to zero, but if there\u2019s no effect, the p-value will hover around zero regardless of sample size, just as the measured ES does. This is pretty intuitive to me.\nBut the commenter you replied to is correct with respect to *practical* considerations such as: large studies being of generally better quality, less likely to be non-representative of the true ES, etc, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Daniel says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 9, 2014 at 5:41 am \nIndeed, larger samples are better (see e.g. recently discussed in Button, K. S., Ioannidis, J. P. A., Mokrysz, C., Nosek, B. A., Flint, J., Robinson, E. S. J., and\nMunafo, M. R. (2013). Power failure: why small sample size undermines the reliability of\nneuroscience. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 14, 365ff. for more details, representativity may not be achieved by just more data, though, see the discussion of failures of \u201cbig data\u201d-analysts to actually consider these statistical issues).\nAnyway, I wanted to reject the idea that the *combination* of \u201chigh\u201d p-values and small sample size is the problem. Indeed it\u2019s quite reasonable to use less strict significance thresholds for smaller sample sizes and on the other hand a high p-value does not become somehow better or more reliable if the sample size increases, indeed, as you imply, p-values of 0.04 will be quite meaningless for samples of more than let\u2019s say 10k respondents. Why? Because the p-value indicates only how likely the result would have been if the H_0 that there is no effect at all would be true, a statistical fiction which is usually not a reasonable possibility at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Anonymous says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 9, 2014 at 11:54 am \nActually, a p-value of .04 is meaningless for small sample sizes, but becomes increasingly meaningful as the sample size increases\u2014but not in the direction one might think.  For generally reasonable prior distributions, as N increases, a p-value of .04 indicates increasing evidence for the null hypothesis.  \nFor example, using a common default prior, and assuming a \u201cmedium\u201d effect size under H1, a 2-tailed p-value of .04 implies Bayes factors (for H1 vs H0) of 1.7, .64, ,.21, and .07) for N=20, 200, 2000, and 20000, respectively.  Only for the largest two sample sizes does the Bayes factor show much support for either hypothesis over the other, and then the favored hypothesis (since BF<1) is the null.  \nYou can verify the above trend by using the Bayes factor calculator here, although your specific numeric results will depend on the prior you choose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n James A.

But, as long as Science is funded by democracies, politics will trump science. \nTo an extent, that\u2019s okay. Most people cannot afford for certain things to be destroyed by the truth, so democracy is an inadvertant and effective defence mechanism. Given the existence of people below IQ 125 (the \u201cstupids\u201d) who are members of different groups, we need to A) stick with democracy-controlled Science, B) obfuscate science the right amount so that it\u2019s still allowed yet the smarter scientists can still keep their jobs, or C) Mechanize the whole thing so that the only thing that can still be accused of heresy is systems of mathematics that are necessary for the rest of the economy to function. \nUntil someone shows that mathematics, and not the mathematicians, have been accused of heresy, I\u2019m going to be partial towards C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Doug S. says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 29, 2014 at 3:15 am \nBem and other parapsychologists should be required to attempt to publish their papers in physics journals.

Is this a disparaging term for basic research, i.e. going somewhere, learning an undocumented language, and writing up a grammar for it? If so, then I admit that a lot of the non-garbage linguistics is \u201cstamp collecting\u201d, but I strongly reject the implicit value judgement in that term.\nIn any case, I suggest historical linguistics as a branch of linguistics which is neither stamp collecting nor unempirical gas-bagging. Phonetics likewise. Phonology has some very good points, but the theoretical spats over generative\/OT models are pretty much useless. Syntax is a wasteland.\nI adopt the maxim \u201cChomsky is wrong about everything\u201d as a good rule of thumb for both linguistics and politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Creutzer says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 2:55 pm \nWell, stamp collection, whether in biology or linguistics, doesn\u2019t develop explanations. That makes me kind of go \u201cmeh\u201d.\nI agree about all your other points. I was just puzzled by the \u201cmajority\u201d statement.\nThere is one thing to be said for the Chomskyans, though: Ironically, they are the better stamp collectors. Just think of all the details about familiar language like English, German, Dutch and Italian that have been discovered by Chomskyans. And those Chomskyans who do turn do the description of new languages often look at things systematically in a way others wouldn\u2019t, and they less often use the word \u201ctopic\u201d in a way that makes me want to strangle them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n name says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 29, 2014 at 11:32 pm \nI once had a college professor who believed in all sorts of parapsychology. One day, in the middle of a lecture, she announced that the class was going to do a\u2026 I forget the term she used and it certainly wasn\u2019t \u201cmind-reading exercise\u201d, but a mind-reading exercise is what it was.\nThis went as follows: Everyone paired off. One person would picture a location important to them for a few minutes, focusing solely on that, and then the other person would close their eyes, notice whatever thoughts came into their head, and try to pick up what the first person was thinking of. Then the two people would switch roles. Class discussion began after the thing was complete.\nVarying degrees of success were reported. \nI noticed myself interpreting the somewhat ambiguous statements of the other person in my pair as in the right general area of it. So it could be that success was only due to suggestibility after the fact.\nBut I gave no ambiguous statements; I said the other guy was thinking of a beach in Hawaii. He said that\u2019s exactly what he had been thinking of. But I found a year later that he didn\u2019t like the professor very much: he was a Catholic and she did not like Christianity at all, and so on, and she\u2019d given him a low grade on one class for disagreeing with her. I can\u2019t remember the chronology here, but the class he got a low grade in was the one least unrelated to that particular subject, and I know it was taught in that same classroom. He didn\u2019t say anything in the class discussion either.

The experiment involved predicting whether the top of a deck of Dominion cards was gold or copper.\nAs it happened, I had played Dominion at this friend\u2019s apartment before, and so I had an unusually good answer to this experiment: I had seen that particular deck of cards before and it was marked. Not deliberately of course, but the rules of Dominion lead to some cards getting used and shuffled much more than others, so if cards start getting worn, they get easy to distinguish.\nThat sort of observation would never, ever appear up in a study writeup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Vanzetti says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 29, 2014 at 11:03 am \nHmmm\u2026\nScience gave us a giant pile of utility.\nParapsychology gave us nothing.\nI feel like this argument is good enough for me to ignore even a million papers in Nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Randy M says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 29, 2014 at 11:29 am \nCan you draw a dividing line between what science-like things are is and what parapsychology-like things are is that cleaves the useful from the useless without begging the question?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Vanzetti says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 29, 2014 at 11:47 am \nNo. But that\u2019s parapsychology we are talking about.

Specifically, artillery officers who aimed their weapons using Aristotelian mechanics (cannonball follows a straight line from the muzzle until it runs out of impetus, then falls straight down at a rate dependent on its mass) missed their targets, while those who used the theories developed by Galileo et al (curved path whose curve depends only on the angle and muzzle velocity of the cannonball, not its mass) hit their targets. And because effective use of artillery was becoming a life-and-death issue for various high-status people, those people paid serious attention to what made their artillery officers better at hitting their targets.\nIn that light, I\u2019d suggest considering putting applied engineering at the top of the pyramid of science. The ultimate confirmation of a theory as substantially correct (*) has to be the ability to use the assumption of that theory\u2019s correctness in actually making and doing things and to have those things actually work in ways that they wouldn\u2019t if the theory were fundamentally flawed. Of course, as I write this, I\u2019m realizing that while this works great for things like using physics theories to build airplanes and rockets, the \u201capplied science\u201d standard can have really shitty results in fields where the appearance of success is easier to come by accidentally. I\u2019ll leave telling the difference between the two cases as a massive unsolved problem.\n(*) \u201cSubstantially correct\u201d has to be qualified because of issues like Newtonian Mechanics being demonstrably wrong in very subtle ways, but it still having practical usefulness because it\u2019s correct enough to correctly predict all sorts of well-understood cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n suntzuanime says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 29, 2014 at 4:43 pm \nIf your psychological theory is so accurate, why aren\u2019t you a cult leader?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Anthony says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 4:41 pm \nI commented below that science with bad epistemology is called \u201cengineering\u201d, but it\u2019s worse than that.

Maybe they want to see how much we can deduce about our world when faced with seemingly inviolable laws of physics that nevertheless seem to be violated. Why? Perhaps they want to find out if they could have missed something in their own model of physics. They think they understand their world fully by now, but then again, there are always some anomalies and fishy results. They might want to run a simulation to see whether, if there really were some monkeywrenches being thrown into otherwise tidy patterns of cause and effect, intelligent beings would be able to infer their existence.\nIs parapsychology the control group, or are we the experimental group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mai La Dreapta says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 9:26 am \n\u201cPsi exists\u201d strikes me as more likely than \u201cWe are in a simulation\u201d, and is favored by my internal implementation of Occam\u2019s Razor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Slippery Jim says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 10:15 am \nSimulation Hypothesis and psi?\nEnter Johnstone\u2019s Paradox\n1.

I\u2019ll start off with the caveat that I\u2019m favorably disposed towards psi and parapsychology, and that I\u2019m fairly well invested in researching the field, but I hope you\u2019ll agree with me that we can have a productive exchange despite this most unsupportable conviction :-). If I am correct, all participants including myself will leave with an enhanced understanding, and perhaps respect, for the positions of both sides of this debate.\nI\u2019ll start by noting my most significant argument in relation to your piece: that if all these experiments, as you graciously concede, are conducted to a standard of science that is generally considered rigorous, are we not well-justified in concluding at least this: \u201cThe possibility that psi phenomena exist must now be seriously considered\u201d? If not; what, I ask, can we say in defense of scientific practice? For if we allow it of ourselves to conduct numerous experiments of high-quality, designed by definition to eliminate (or at least strongly mitigate) explanations alternate to the one we have decided to test for, and then do not even bequeath to our conclusions\u2014upon finding a positive result\u2014the concession that the original explanation is a viable one, how do we justify our first impetus to scientifically investigate that explanation in the first place?\nTo illustrate my difference to your position, consider the following quote from your essay:\n\u201cAfter all, a good Bayesian should be able to say \u201cWell, I got some impressive results, but my prior for psi is very low, so this raises my belief in psi slightly, but raises my belief that the experiments were confounded a lot.\u201d\nI\u2019m led to question whether you really did not mean to say something slightly different. After all, if we take these words at face value, can we not\u2014satirically\u2014call them a decent formula for confirmation bias? A prior belief is examined with a strenuous test; that test lends evidence against the belief; we therefore conclude the test is more likely to have been flawed (i.e. evidence against our position causes us to reaffirm our belief). How do you counter this? IMO, statistical inference, whether bayesian or frequentist, only allows us to rule out the hypothesis of chance\u2014it says nothing about the methodology behind an experiment. Thus, people only ever accept the p-value or Bayes factor of a study literally if they already believe the experiments were well-done.\nNow let me address some of your specific points, to see if I cannot make the psi hypothesis a slightly more plausible one to you:\nYou mention Wiseman & Schlitz (1997), an oft-cited study in parapsychology circles, as strong evidence that the experimenter effect is operating here. I certainly agree. At the end of their collaboration, both had conducted four separate experiments, where three of Schlitz\u2019s were positive and significant, and zero of Wiseman\u2019s were. Their results can only be explained in two ways: (1) psi does not exist, and the positive results are due to experimenter bias, and (2) psi does exist, and the negative-positive schism is still related to experimenter effects. Let\u2019s ignore issues of power, fraud, and data selectivity for now (if you find them convincing, we can discuss them in another post).\nThe rub, for me, is that this is an example of a paper that is designed to offer evidence against hypothesis (1)\u2014Wiseman certainly wasn\u2019t happy about it. The reason is that both experimenters ran protocols that were precisely the same but for their prior level of interaction with subjects (and their role as starers), ostensibly eliminating methodology as a confounding problem. Smell or other sensory cues, for example (as was mentioned in the above comments), could not have been the issue; staring periods were conducted over closed circuit television channels, and the randomization of the stare\/no-stare periods was undertaken by a pseudo-random algorithm, where no feedback was given during the session that would allow subjects to detect, consciously or subconsciously, any of the impossibly subtle micro-regularities that might have occasioned in the protocol.\nNow, you\u2014understandably, from your position\u2014criticize hypothesis (2), but consider the following remarks from Schlitz and Wiseman, after their experiment had been completed:\n\u201cIn the October 2002 issue of The Paranormal Review, Caroline Watt asked each of them [Wiseman and Schlitz] what kind of preparations they make before starting an experiment. Their answers were: Schlitz: [\u2026] \u201cI tell people that there is background research that\u2019s been done already that suggests this works [\u2026] I give them a very positive expectation of outcome.\u201d Wiseman: \u201cIn terms of preparing myself for the session, absolutely nothing\u201d\nThe social affect of both experimenters seems to have been qualitatively different; we can say this almost with complete certainty (and it\u2019s not unexpected). If we acknowledge, then, such confounding factors as \u201cpygmalion effects\u201d (Rosenthal, 1969), it would be only rational to conclude that\u2014should psi exist\u2014attempts to exhibit it would be influenced by them. Even more clearly, IMO (and why parapsychologists tend to see this experiment as consistent with their ideas), it was Wiseman who did the staring in the null experiments, and Schlitz who did the staring in the positive ones. Would it not make sense that a believer in psi would be more \u201cpsychic\u201d than a skeptic, if psi exists? (or that a person with confidence in their abilities could make a better theatrical performance, or more likely deduce the solution to a complex mathematical problem, if they are not insecure about their skill level?)\nParapsychologists are only following the data, to the best of their ability. You\u2019ll find that, under the psi hypothesis, the discrepancy in success is relatively simple to explain, whereas under the skeptical explanation we must conclude such a thing as that the most miniscule variation in experimental conditions\u2014so miniscule that it must be postulated apart from the description of the protocol and will likely never be directly identified\u2014can cause a study to be either significant or a failure. We must, in other words, logically determine that our science is still utterly incapable of dealing with simple experimenter bias; not just on the level of producing spurious conclusions more often than not (as Ioannidis et al show), but to the degree of failing to reliably assess literally any moderately small effect. This is itself a powerful claim.\nBut I will return to the nature of the psi hypothesis later. For now, I will cover parapsychological experimenter effects more broadly. Consider the following: as we probably both agree, Robert Rosenthal is one of those scientists who has done a great deal of work to bring expectancy influences to our attention; his landmark (1986) book, \u201cExperimenter Effects in Behavioral Research\u201d, for example, has not inconsiderably advanced our understanding of self-fulfilling prophecies in science. Would it then surprise you to learn that Rosenthal has spoken favorably on the resistance of a category of psi studies (called ganzfeld experiments) to just the sort of idea expounded by hypothesis (2)? See the following quote from Carter (2010):\n\u201cGanzfeld research would do very well in head-to-head comparisons with mainstream research. The experimenter-derived artifacts described in my 1966 (enlarged edition 1976) book Experimenter Effects in Behavioral Research were better dealt with by ganzfeld researchers than by many researchers in more traditional domains.\u201d\nWhat if I told you that Rosenthal & Harris (1998) co-wrote a paper evaluating psi, in response to a government request, with overall favorable conclusions towards its existence; would you be inclined to read a little more of the literature on parapsychology? (The reference here is \u201cEnhancing Human Performance: Background Papers, Issues of Theory and Methodology\u201d) \nWhatever you believe about psi, I agree with you that examination of parapsychological results can do much to bolster our understanding of setbacks in experimentation; however, I also believe that thinking and examining our many attempts (and there are quite literally thousands of experiments, and dozens of categories, with their own literature) to grapple with potentially psychic effects, have the merit of helping to engender a truly reflective spirit of inquiry, for the reason that they represent precisely that ideal of science that we dream of meeting\u2014using data and argument to resolve deeply controversial, and potentially game-changing, issues. \nOn a superficial level, we already have evidence that parapsychology employs much more rigorous safeguards against experimenter effects than most any other scientific discipline. Watt & Naategal (2004), for example, conducted a survey and found that parapsychology had run 79.1% of its research using a double-blind methodology, compared to 0.5% in the physical sciences, 2.4% in the biological sciences, 36.8% in the medical sciences, and 14.5% in the psychological sciences. These findings are consistent with those of an earlier survey on experimenter effects by Sheldrake (1998), which found an even greater disparity favorable to parapsychology.\nOriginating out of vigorous debates between proponents and skeptics, however, I find it intuitively plausible that this should be the case (the same amount of vehement scrutiny used to contest telepathy is not used to criticize studies of the effect of alcohol on memory, for example), so these findings\u2014while a bit surprising to me\u2014don\u2019t seem, on reflection, to be very much out of place.\nI think, however\u2014and you will probably agree with me\u2014that I could ramble on about\nsafeguards and variables all day, without any effect on your opinion, if I do not discuss the most crucial, foundational issues pertaining to psi. It would be like trying to convince you that studies of astrology have rigorously eliminated alternate explanations; after all, if the hypothesis we would have to entertain is that the stars themselves, billions of miles away, determine our likelihood to get laid on any given day, it doesn\u2019t matter how strong the data is\u2014we will always suspect a flaw.\nI therefore suggest we take a wide-angle view, for a moment, on the psi question. We cannot hope to be properly disposed towards its investigation if we do not\u2014certainly it would be unacceptable to simply absorb  the popular bias against it, without critical thought, since that\u2019s exactly the religious mindset we  eschew; neither would it be acceptable to enjoin its possibility because we want it to be true, or because it\u2019s widespread in the media.\nLet me first address the physical argument. I\u2019m well-versed in the literature of physics and psi myself, but my friend, Max, is a theoretical physics graduate studying condensed matter physics, with a long-standing interest in parapsychology. He and I both agree that you are overestimating the degree to which psi and physics clash. Before I state why, consider that our opinion is not so unusual, for those who have thought about the question at length; Henry Margenau, David Bohm, Brian Josephson, Evan Harris Walker, Henry Stapp, Olivier Costa de Beauregard, York Dobyns, and others are examples of physicists who either believe that psi is already compatible with modern physics, or else think (more plausibly, IMO) that the current physical framework is suggestive of psi. De Beauregard actually thinks psi is demanded by modern physics, and has written so.\nIn light of these positions, you will see that our perspective is not an unreasonable one to maintain. Basically, we agree that if we take physical theory in its most conventional form (hoping thereby to reflect the \u201ccurrent consensus\u201d), psi and physics are just barely incompatible. I say \u201cjust barely\u201d because we have such suggestive phenomena as Bell\u2019s EPR correlations, which Einstein himself derided as telepathy, (but which we now have incontrovertibly proved through experiment) that show how two particles may remain instantaneously connected at indefinite distances from each other, if once they interacted. It is true that this phenomenon of entanglement is exceptionally fragile; however, experimental evidence in physics and biophysics journals these days purports to show its presence in everything from the photosynthesis of algae to the magnetic compass of migrating birds, and more such claims accrue all the time. Entanglement is entering warm biological systems.\nThe incompatibility arises if we conceive of psi as an information signal; if we think something is \u201ctransmitted\u201d; because the no-signaling theorem in quantum mechanics says EPR phenomena are just spooky correlations, not classical communication. You cannot use an entangled particle, as Alice, to get a message to Bob, for example, in physics parlance. However some parapsychologists and physicists don\u2019t think of psi as a transfer, and lend to it the same spooky status as EPR\u2014unexplained non-local influence. If this is correct, and you are willing to accept that non-local principles can scale up to large biological organisms (as the trend of the evidence is indicating), but to a larger degree than has ever been experimentally verified (outside parapsychology, of course), then certain forms of psi are already compatible with physics (e.g. telepathy).\nIt may also surprise you to know that the AAAS convened a panel discussion on the compatibility of physics and psi, with numerous physicists in attendance, where the general consensus was that physics cannot yet rule out even phenomena like precognition. The main reason given was that the equations of physics are time-symmetric; they work forwards and backwards equally well. There are, in fact, interpretations of quantum mechanics like TSQM that play explicitly on this principle, with optics experiments unrelated to parapsychology designed to provide evidence for retro-causality (e.g. Tollaksen, Aharanov, Zeilinger). Some of them exhibit results that are rather intuitively and elegantly explained under a retro-causal model, and have more convoluted mathematical interpretations in other frameworks (all QM experiments at this time can be explained by all the interpretations, to various degrees).\nI would talk more about other ways that psi and physics can be reconciled, such as by introducing slight non-linearities in QM, but I sense that this may bury my point rather than clarify it. Where psi and physics are concerned, therefore, I say just this: that if physicists can unblinkingly confront the possibility of inflating space, multiple universes, retro-causality, observer-dependent time, universal constants, black holes, worm holes, extra dimensions, and vibrating cosmic strings\u2014much for which there exists fleetingly little experimental evidence, a good deal of theoretical modeling, and a lot of funding\u2014we cannot, with a straight face, dismiss a considerable body of experimental evidence for something as mundane as telepathy\u2014or of slightly more significance: precognition (the future doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cfixed\u201d to explain these experiments, BTW).\nNow, if you\u2019re looking for evidence that Bem\u2019s experiments themselves, and their replications, were well-conducted, and well-guarded against spurious expectancy effects, thus providing parapsychological evidence for retro-causality, I can only say that I personally think they were, having read the relevant papers and thought about their methodologies. However, my area of expertise relates more to ganzfeld experiments (telepathy), which in my opinion convincingly show that critics have been unable to account for the results. I have been led to this conclusion by personal examination of the data, as well as debate, and in this capacity I have seen every methodological and statistical criticism in the book, as well as every parapsychological rejoinder to them. IMO, no one has yet been able to identify a single flaw in either the ganzfeld experiments or the treatment of those experiments that can successfully account for their results\u2014and none of the major skeptics purport to. I am happy to debate anyone on this issue. A paper authored by myself and Max, in fact, will be coming out in the Journal of Parapsychology in June, on that very subject, if you care to read it; it tackles a number of general criticisms of psi research, with a focus on the ganzfeld, using empirical and theoretical approaches. Look for \u201cBeyond the Coin Toss: Examining Wiseman\u2019s Criticisms of Parapsychology\u201d. At the parapsychology convention in San Francisco this year, as well, we may likely do a presentation on it. \nThe rub on the ganzfeld, by the way, is this: where the baseline expected hit rate is 25%, the observed hit rate is 32%, across thousands of trials and more than hundred experiments; and if we partition trials into those where subjects have been specially selected in accord with characteristics predicted to significantly enhance performance, we instead find hit rates of upwards of 40% (with 27% as the average proportion of hits across unselected subjects). A main focus of our paper is the proposal that we can better the ganzfeld experiments by focusing on these special subjects.\nAs I wrap up, I will admit to finding this extremely fascinating. Confronted with the kind of findings I discussed, I find myself saying\u2014as we are often impelled to do, in science, by strange data\u2014that it didn\u2019t have to be this way. And it didn\u2019t. For every example of a spuriously successful scientific hypothesis, I would wager that there are a dozen that simply didn\u2019t make it. We could have obtained a packet of null studies in parapsychology, but instead we wound up with a collection of successively improved, robust, and (many) methodologically formidable experiments (many are also poorly conducted) that collectively\u2014in almost every paradigm examined to date\u2014exhibit astronomically significant departures from chance. Intelligent people have performed and assailed these experiments, but no satisfactory explanation exists today for them.\nIs it possible that this seeming signal in the noise is psi? I think so. Physics doesn\u2019t rule it out; some aspects are even suggestive. People, also, have anecdotally claimed its existence for millennia, so psi is not without an observational precedent. Nor is it without an experimental precedent, as many experiments conducted from the turn of the 19th century to today have sought to evidence it, and found results consistent with the hypothesis. \nShould we be surprised at psi? Of course\u2014the phenomenon defies our basic intuitions; I\u2019m not claiming we shouldn\u2019t be skeptical. But we should also be open-minded, and not hostile. Psi touches our scientific imaginations; it has accompanied our scientific journey from its inception (one of the first proposals for the scientific method, made by Francis Bacon was to study psi). It is directly in connection with investigating it, in fact, that several of our favorite procedures came into being, such as blinding and meta-analysis.\nI conclude this commentary with the following point: if, after having obtained results like those I just described and alluded to, as well as those you eloquently summarized for us, all that we can bring ourselves is to say is \u201cthere must have been an error someplace\u201d, I respectfully contend that what has failed is not our science, but our imagination. It is not time for scientists to throw out their method; it is not time for us to conclude that an evidence-based worldview cannot survive in the face of human bias; rather, it is time for scientists to become genuinely excited about the possibility of psi. We need more mainstream researchers, more funding, and more support to decide the question. Surely you will concede it is an interesting one. In pursuit of its answer, much is to be gained in understanding either Nature or our own practices in connection with investigating her mysteries.\n* If any of what I have said interests you, I highly recommend reading the following exchange between my colleague, Max, and Massimo Pigliucci (a skeptic), on the topic of parapsychology\u2014especially the comments. The debate is illuminating. \nhttp:\/\/rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com\/2011\/12\/alternative-take-on-esp.html\nhttp:\/\/rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com\/2012\/01\/on-parapsychology.html\nThank you for an interesting read.\nBest, \u2013 Johann\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n anon says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 5:59 pm \nTL;DR Version\n\u2013 When Scott used Bayes\u2019 Theorem to update towards the result that the study was flawed, that was more or less confirmation bias.\n\u2013 Statistics can only tell us about probability not other things (this argument made no sense to me, I might be misunderstanding it).\n\u2013 Skeptics block psi effects which is why only believers discover their effects.\n\u2013 People are more skeptical of psi than other phenomena, unfairly.\n\u2013 Lots of smart people believe in psi and have published studies on it.\n\u2013 Physics doesn\u2019t rule out psi.

It is your choice whether to include this perspective in your assessment.\nI am also more than happy to answer any questions you may have about my arguments.

However, how *much* we increase them depends on the ratio of our priors.\nSuppose that before hearing this, we thought there was a 1\/10 chance of any given meta-analysis being flawed (even one as rigorous as this one), and a 1\/1000 chance of psi existing.\nNow we get a meta-analysis saying psi exists. For the sake of simplicity let\u2019s ignore its p-value for now and just say it 100% proves its point.\nIn 1000 worlds where someone does a meta-analysis on psi, 100 will have the meta-analysis be flawed and 1 will have psi exist. \nThe results of this study show we\u2019re in either the 100 or the 1. So our probabilities should now be:\n1\/101 = ~0.99% chance psi exists\n100\/101 = ~99.1% chance the meta-analysis is flawed\nI think it\u2019s a little more complicated than this, because we know there are other parapsychological experiments whose success or failure is correlated with this one. It\u2019s probably not true that if a similar meta-analysis came out, I\u2019d have to update to 90\/10. And the fact that there have been a lot of studies looking for psi that found none also has to figure in somewhere.\nBut this is the basic dynamic at work making me thing of this as \u201cmostly casts doubt on analysis\u201d rather than \u201cmostly proves psi\u201d\nRegarding my low prior, you make a physics argument, and I\u2019m not really qualified to judge. But I don\u2019t find psi physically too implausible, in the sense that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, a hundred years from now, scientists can create a machine that does a lot of the things psi is supposed to be able to do (manipulate objects remotely, receive messages from the future, etc).\nMy worries are mostly biological. Psi would require that we somehow evolved the ability to make use of very exotic physics, integrated it with the rest of our brain, and did so in a way that leaves no physical trace in the sense of a visible dedicated organ for doing so. The amount of clearly visible wiring and genes and brain areas necessary to produce and process visual input is obvious to everyone \u2013 from anatomists dissecting the head to molecular biologists looking at gene function to just anybody who looks at a person and sees they have eyes. And it\u2019s not just the eyes, it\u2019s the occipital cortex and all of the machinery involved in processing visual input into a mechanism the rest of the brain can understand. That\u2019s taken a few hundred million years to evolve and it\u2019s easy to trace every single step in the evolutionary chain. If there were psi, I would expect it to have similarly obvious correlates.\nThere\u2019s also the question of how we could spend so much evolutionary effort exploiting weird physics to evolve a faculty that doesn\u2019t even really work. I don\u2019t think any parapsychologist has found that psi increases our ability to guess things over chance more than five to ten percent. And even that\u2019s only in very very unnatural conditions like the ganzfeld. The average person doesn\u2019t seem to derive any advantage from psi in their ordinary lives. The only possible counterexample might be if some fighting reflexes were able to respond to enemy moves tiny fractions of a second before they were made \u2013 but it would be very strange for a psi that evolved for split second decisions to also be able to predict far future (also, this would run into paradoxes). Another possibility might be that psi is broken in modern humans for some reason (increased brain size? lifestyle?). But I don\u2019t know of any animal psi results that are well-replicated.\nThese difficulties magnify when you remember that psi seems to be a whole collection of abilities that would each require different exotic physics. As weird as it would be to have invisible organ-less non-adaptive-fitness-providing mechanisms for one, that multiplies when you need precognition AND telepathy AND telekinesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 1, 2014 at 3:41 pm \nWell, Scott, you bring up some good points. Thank you for the swift and gracious reply. I will address your argument about Bayesian priors first.\nThe way I see it, there is something strange about your approach, and that is that if you use a two prior system, the experimental evidence becomes essentially superfluous\u2014and however logical the grounding for it may be, if this is the case we must be led to seriously question it. Consider: no matter how many meta-analyses we conduct, or how many experiments, if your priors are at 1\/10 for flaws and 1\/1000 for psi (a reasonable psi prior, BTW), you will always accept the flaw hypothesis. Not to put too fine a point on it, but if we were randomly selecting from infinite possible worlds where we conduct a meta-analysis, we would always have a 100 times greater chance of selecting a world with flaws than with psi, and thus also a 99.1% chance of being in the world with flaws (given a positive MA) and a .99% chance of being in the world with psi. What\u2019s remarkable to me is that it wouldn\u2019t matter how many positive MAs we got, sequentially; these probabilities would hold steady!\nMy concern is that the two-prior system is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and not how Bayesian ideas should actually play out. But that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not unreasonable, in certain contexts, to think this way. We all know human beings have only a limited time to pursue what interests them; from the perspective of a person trying to make rational decisions about what to pursue and what to avoid\u2014for whom parapsychology is just one of a mass of unreliable claims\u2014it makes sense to default on the flaw hypothesis. However, for someone who has decided that the field is worth a more intense form of scrutiny, this analysis cannot be acceptable. I have the burden of proof in this discussion; it is my job to persuade you that parapsychology is worth the latter, and not the former, treatment.\nEven a flaws prior based on empirical estimates of problematic meta-analyses is still only the crudest approximation to the \u201ctrue\u201d error prior of any MA; what it does is it uses the roughshod general quality of a scientific discipline (in this case all meta-analyses!) to predetermine the amount of evidence in one example\u2014again, a perfectly reasonable approach for estimating the likelihood of success, generally, or of any particular meta-analysis one doesn\u2019t want to invest time in, but rather superficial for a question one wants to have an accurate answer to. I don\u2019t know about you, but I want to have a superbly accurate answer to whether psi exists\u2014it\u2019s of great importance to me, and I will be satisfied with nothing less.\nTo the genuinely moved investigator, I think, the first step is to undertake a considerable analysis of the experimental and statistical methodology. The flaws prior must disappear, to be replaced with the condition that if any flaw is found which the investigator deems influential, the resulting p-value of the evidence (or Bayes factor) must be left in serious question until such time as it can be shown that (1) the flaw did not exist or (2) it could not have significantly impacted the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scott Alexander says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 1, 2014 at 8:27 pm \nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as pessimistic as you make it sound.\nIn theory, if this meta-analysis dectupled my probability to 1%, the next one that comes out positive should dectuple my probability to (almost) 10%, and so on.\nIn practice this doesn\u2019t work because I assume that, if this meta-analysis is systematically flawed, the next one shares those same flaws. But you could raise my probability by showing it doesn\u2019t. For example, if the next meta-analysis fixes the problem I mention above about lack of conclusive evidence in peer-reviewed exact replications, that should raise my probability further, and so on.\nYou ask below what evidence I would find conclusive. I don\u2019t think I would find any single study conclusive. But if some protocol was invented that consistently showed a large positive effect size for psi, and it was replicated dozens of times with few or no negative replication attempts, and it was even replicated when investigated by skeptics like Wiseman, I think that would be enough to make me believe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 3, 2014 at 7:19 pm \nThe problem with the two-prior system is that even if the flaws prior varies between meta-analyses\u2014which I agree is better than keeping it fixed\u2014it still has the effect of turning the Bayes factor of any particular meta-analysis into little more than a large constant by which to multiply your predetermined priors, leaving the same relative odds for your hypotheses at the end of the analysis as at the beginning. \nEssentially, the approach seems to me to be slapping numbers onto what people already do: disregard the Bayes Factor or the p-value if they think flaws are more likely than the result of the MA.\nAll I\u2019m saying is that determining that last part\u2014the likelihood that flaws are really a more reasonable explanation\u2014requires an exhaustive, self-driven inspection, if one genuinely wants to avoid a Type II error as well as Type I error.\nI also think you may have misread the results of published exact replications because you left out\nBem (2012)\nN=42\nES=0.290\nSavva et al. (2004)\nN=25\nES=0.34\nSavva et al. Study 1 (2005)\nN=50\nES=0.288\nSavva et al. Study 2 (2005)\nN=92\nEs=-0.058\nSavva\u2019s studies can be listed as exact replications of Bem, without precognition, because they stated explicitly in their papers that they were replicating Bem (2003), the first series of habituation experiments in Bem (2011) which Bem presented at a PA convention 11 years ago. Bem (2012), also, counts as a legitimate prospective replication of Bem (2011), IMO.\nIf you factor in these missing studies, you now have 6\/11 positively directional results, five of which display effect sizes from .27 to .34, and only two of which display negative effect sizes of comparable magnitude. Just eyeballing it, I\u2019m willing to bet that a combination of these ES values would result in an aggregate ES of around 0.09, the reported value for exact replications of Bem in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 3, 2014 at 10:30 pm \nI\u2019m also interested in hearing your perspective on the fact that not only was there a general overall result in Bem et al. (2014), but several observations, as well, that run directly counter to what we might predict in the absence of an effect. I\u2019d like to see what you think about the strength of such observations as evidence against the experimenter error\/manipulation hypothesis.\n For example:\n(1) Consider that the much talked about \u201cexperimenter degrees of freedom\u201d would be expected to more strongly impact conceptual rather than exact replications\u2014hardly a controversial point\u2014yet the ES of the conceptual experiments is lower than that of the exact. Indeed, exact replications have the highest ES of the batch.\nAlso, if you read Table 1 carefully, as well as the paragraph before it, you will see that all the experiments listed under \u201cIndependent Replications of Bem\u2019s experiments\u201d exclude Bem\u2019s original findings, including the \u201cexact replications\u201d, so the point you make above in your essay that he counted those in the analysis is, I believe, mistaken.\n(2) There were very noticeable differences between  fast-thinking and slow-thinking experiments, as well as no obvious reason why this should be according to the experimenter manipulation hypothesis. In particular, every single fast-thinking category yielded a p-value of less than .003, but both types of slow-thinking experiments yielded p-values above .10. Bem gives a good explanation of this in terms of the psi hypothesis, pointing out that online experiments seemed to have very strongly hampered the ES of slow-thinking protocols. It seems to me the experimenter error\/manipulation hypothesis would be at a loss to account for this; why should it be that slow-thinking protocols or online administration of these protocols lower incidences of bias? \nI think the safeguards of these experiments pretty much rule out sensory cues; therefore the skeptical explanation must lie in p-hacking, multiple analysis, experimenter degrees of freedom, selective outcome reporting, etc. However (1) seems inconsistent with most of this, the check for p-hacking failed to find a result, and (2) decisively refutes the prediction that such biases evenly affected fast and slow-thinking protocols\u2014the most straightforward prediction we would have made prior to seeing the results.\nI\u2019m not claiming any of this is conclusive, but I am saying that when you think carefully about some of the results in this MA, they take you by surprise. This is the kind of ancillary data that contributes to the veracity of an effect as much or more than the basic overall effect measure, IMO; if these types of suggestive trends weren\u2019t present throughout parapsychology databases, I would find them less convincing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 4, 2014 at 12:53 am \nBTW, Max just told me that he did the sample-size weighted mean calculation for the ES values I report plus the ones you report: the result is 0.0802. This exactly confirms what I said in my above post, and refutes the contention that published exact replications of Bem\u2019s studies fail to replicate the results of the 31 reported exact replications, published or not, in Bem et al. (2014).\nMax also bets there is heterogeneity across these ES values, given their extreme variance; an I^2 test on them might be appropriate. If moderate to great heterogeneity was found, it would count as further evidence against the null.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 1, 2014 at 7:15 pm \nI don\u2019t have time to address the physics\/biology argument in detail now, but consider just these few points: \n(1) psi is taken by many parapsychologists to be nothing more than an artifact of retrocausality; under the DATS model of psi, which makes testable predictions, psi is just the collateral of a conscious process that slips backwards and forwards in time (we don\u2019t need to factor in long-term precognition right now, since the evidence for that is mostly anecdotal). See: http:\/\/www.lfr.org\/lfr\/csl\/library\/DATjp.pdf \nEDIT: Retrocausality can explain, BTW, the results of probably most, if not all, psi experiments. It is also one of the ways entanglement has been theorized to work, and  it is entailed by the TSQM model of quantum mechanics. Bell\u2019s theorem, if I recall, establishes a non-local, anti-realist, OR retrocausal universe. Most physicists opt for non-locality, but I think the experimental evidence from the physicists I mentioned, as well as from parapsychology, should prompt us to examine the retrocausality option more carefully.\nFor a fascinating series of physiological psi experiments which complement Bem\u2019s and offer evidence for presentiment, where another comprehensive meta-analysis has also been published, see: http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2012.00390\/pdf\nThe effect size of the above experiments is considerably larger than Bem\u2019s, on the order of the ganzfeld findings.\n(2) It is true that we haven\u2019t found an obvious organ associated with the \u201cpsi sense\u201d, but it is also true that the human body has a number of senses beyond the five\u2014precisely how many is constantly in debate\u2014that don\u2019t have organs as clear as eyes, for example, \n(3) The brain has been rightly termed the most complex object in the known universe; so complex it contains the mystery of conscious experience\u2014the \u201cHard Problem\u201d\u2014which has bewildered neuroscientists and philosophers for centuries.\nWhen it comes to spooky physics, consider that we have predicted entanglement to occur in the eyes of birds, with empirical and theoretical evidence (still in debate), as well as in the photosynthesis of algae, and also quantum tunneling in proteins across the biological spectrum; if this is the case, imagine the level of spooky physics that might take place in a human brain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n suntzuanime says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 1, 2014 at 7:29 pm \nTo be fair, it doesn\u2019t take much to bewilder philosophers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 1, 2014 at 7:18 pm \nA final question for now: what level of evidence would convince you that some form of psi exists? What sort of experiment, under what conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Troy says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 2, 2014 at 12:15 pm \nThere\u2019s also the question of how we could spend so much evolutionary effort exploiting weird physics to evolve a faculty that doesn\u2019t even really work. I don\u2019t think any parapsychologist has found that psi increases our ability to guess things over chance more than five to ten percent. And even that\u2019s only in very very unnatural conditions like the ganzfeld. The average person doesn\u2019t seem to derive any advantage from psi in their ordinary lives.\nOne of the most common \u201cpsychic\u201d anecdotes that I hear is some variation of the following story: I had a sense that something was wrong with my Aunt Bea, so I picked up the phone and called, and my brother answered and said that she just had a heart attack. I think such anecdotes are especially common among twins and other close relatives.\nLet\u2019s assume that there\u2019s actually some kind of telepathy going on here and that it\u2019s either explained by genetic similarities or close emotional connections. Either way, it seems plausible that being able to (even highly fallibly) tell when your close genetic relative or emotional companion is in trouble could be of significant evolutionary advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n gwern says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 6, 2014 at 6:52 pm \nLet\u2019s assume that there\u2019s actually some kind of telepathy going on here and that it\u2019s either explained by genetic similarities or close emotional connections. Either way, it seems plausible that being able to (even highly fallibly) tell when your close genetic relative or emotional companion is in trouble could be of significant evolutionary advantage.\nNice thing about the evolutionary theory is that it suggests quite a few testable predictions: since it seems clear that psi, if it exists, varies between people, if it\u2019s genetically based we should see the usual factor results from sibling\/fraternal-twin\/identical-twin studies; we should see dramatic increases in psi strength when we pair related or unrelated people in ganzfeld or staring studies (presumably identical-twin and then parent-child bonds are strongest, but we might expect subtler effects like stronger dad-son & mom-daughter communication, weaker communication among people related by adoption etc), we should be able to show decreases in communication between couples who were linked in 1 session but had broken up by the next sesssion, and so on. You can probably think of more implications. (Hm\u2026 would we expect people who grew up in dangerous places or countries, and so whose relatives\/close-ones would be more likely to be at risk, to have greater receptiveness?)\nOn the other hand, when we try to put it in evolutionary terms as kin selection, it casts a lot of doubt on the hypothesis, since the benefit doesn\u2019t seem to be big and so selection would be weak. I\u2019m not a population genetics expert, but I\u2019ll try to do some estimating\u2026\nThe benefit: remember the quip \u2013 you would sacrifice yourself for 2 siblings, 4 nephews, 8 cousins\u2026 How often does one feel worried about Aunt Bea? And how often is Aunt Bea actually in trouble? (It\u2019s no good for the psi sense if it spits out false negatives or positives, it only helps when it generate a true positive and alerts you when the relative is in danger.) Speaking for myself, I\u2019ve never had that experience. Even the people who generate such anecdotes don\u2019t seem to experience such events more than a few times in a lifetime. Imagine that you\u2019re alerted, say, 3 or 4 times in a lifetime, a quarter are correct, and you have even odds of saving their lives single-handedly, and also that they\u2019re still young enough to reproduce, and you costlessly wind up saving Aunt Bea\u2019s life. You\u2019re related by a quarter to Aunt Bea, I think (half comes from mother, mother will be sibling-related to Aunt Bea, so 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, right?), then your inclusive fitness gain here is 0.25 * (1\/4) * (1\/2) = +0.03125. I think these are generous figures and the true s is a lot lower, but let\u2019s go with it.\nSo let\u2019s say that if psi were a single mutation rather than a whole bunch, it has a selective advantage of 0.03125. An advantage doesn\u2019t guarantee that the mutation will become widespread through the population, since the original bearers can just get unlucky before reproducing much. One good approximation to estimate fitness is apparently simply doubling the selective advantage (http:\/\/rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/5\/28\/1279.long \u03c0\u22482s), so then the probability of fixation is 6%.\nSo if such a mutation were to ever happen, it\u2019s highly unlikely that it would then spread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n endoself says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 6, 2014 at 10:15 pm \nIf it appears once it is unlikely to spread. Many mutations that increase fitness by 3% have reached fixation, since the same mutation, or different mutations with the same effects, can occur many times given a large enough population and enough time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n gwern says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 6, 2014 at 10:48 pm \nYes, but the question of how often a psi single mutation would arise leads us to the question of whether that\u2019s remotely plausible (no), hence it must be a whole assemblage of related pieces, and that leads us to the question of how psi could possibly work, much less evolve incrementally; and I\u2019d rather not get into that just to make my point that the fitness & probability fixation can\u2019t be very big.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Anonymous says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 4, 2014 at 3:29 pm \nThis experiment produced results that could only possibly happen if either psi existed or the experiment was flawed, so we should increase both probabilities. However, how *much* we increase them depends on the ratio of our priors.\nThat\u2019s patently wrong.  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that the amount by which our prior odds change in response to new evidence is independent of those prior odds:\nPosterior odds = Bayes factor \u00d7 Prior odds , \nwhere the Bayes factor, the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of the two hypotheses we are considering, quantifies the relative weight of the evidence for those two hypotheses. \nSuppose that before hearing this, we thought there was a 1\/10 chance of any given meta-analysis being flawed (even one as rigorous as this one), and a 1\/1000 chance of psi existing.\nNow we get a meta-analysis saying psi exists. For the sake of simplicity let\u2019s ignore its p-value for now and just say it 100% proves its point.\nIn 1000 worlds where someone does a meta-analysis on psi, 100 will have the meta-analysis be flawed and 1 will have psi exist.\nThe results of this study show we\u2019re in either the 100 or the 1. So our probabilities should now be:\n1\/101 = ~0.99% chance psi exists 100\/101 = ~99.1% chance the meta-analysis is flawed.\nThe new evidence increases your odds of the psi vs the non-psi hypothesis; thus it is evidence in favor of the psi hypothesis relative to the non-psi hypothesis.  It is fundamental to Bayesian inference that if enough such evidence accumulates, the probability of the psi hypothesis must approach 1 in the limit.  However, if you continue to update your odds in the manner you describe, your probability of psi can never exceed 1\/2.  Thus, no amount of such evidence could ever convince you of the psi hypothesis, in contradiction of a fundamental Bayesian law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jesper \u00d6stman says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 4, 2014 at 3:09 am \nInteresting points. I looked for 4 studies by Wiseman and Schlitz but could only find 3.

These were Wiseman & Smith (1994), Wiseman et al. (1995), and Schlitz & LaBerge (1994). I count these as semi-evidential; kind of like preliminary studies; which offered results suggestive of an experimenter effect, but which were then reproduced under more rigorous conditions.\nI missed one of those studies though, so the revised count should be Shlitz: 3\/4 and Wiseman: 0\/5, three of which for Schlitz (2 successes\/3) were part of the collaboration, and three of which for Wiseman (3 failures\/3) were as well. \nAltogether, given that every success mentioned is an\nindependently significant experiment, the statistical fluke hypothesis is unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 5, 2014 at 5:18 am \n* I say \u201ccarried out studies with null results\u201d above, but what I really meant was Wiseman got null results and Schlitz got positive results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tApril 30, 2014 at 7:22 pm \nThe following popular article in Nature mentions a few examples:\nhttp:\/\/www.nature.com\/news\/2011\/110615\/pdf\/474272a.pdf\nThere is a decent talk on the subject by physicist Jim Al-Khalili, at the Royal Academy, unconnected with parapsychology (he\u2019s got a great bow-tie, though):\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wwgQVZju1ZM\n^ If the above link doesn\u2019t show, type \u201cJim Al-Khalili \u2013 Quantum Life: How Physics Can Revolutionise Biology\u201d into Youtube instead.\nThere are also a number of references:\nSarovar, Mohan; Ishizaki, Akihito; Fleming, Graham R.; Whaley, K.

Consistently low results have been found for belief among psychologists; in Wagener & Monet (1979), psychologists who thought psi was either \u201can established fact or a likely possibility\u201d were just 36% of the total, compared to 55% natural scientists, and 65% social scientists.\nWhen it comes to the scientific elite, however, it is another matter. Here, evidence from McClenon (1982) seems to point to unambiguous skeptical dominance, with less than 30% of AAAS leaders holding to the likelihood of psi. Still, 30% is a lot of scientists\u2014especially given these are the board members of the AAAS, the largest scientific academy in the world. Add to that the fact that the Parapsychological Association is an affiliate member of the AAAS\u2014despite a vigorous campaign to remove them in 1979\u2014and you have an interesting situation.\nWe must keep in mind that while both of these pieces of information are interesting, they shouldn\u2019t do much to sway our judgement. In both surveys, it is difficult to gauge to what extent the opinions of those polled were formed in response to the empirical evidence.\nYou may find the Wagener & Monet (1979) results here: http:\/\/www.tricksterbook.com\/truzzi\/\u2026ScholarNo5.pdf\nA larger body of results is reviewed here: http:\/\/en.wikademia.org\/Surveys_of_academic_opinion_regarding_parapsychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPingback: Links For May 2014 | Slate Star Codex\n\n\nPingback: The motto of th\u2026 | On stuff.\n\n\n\n\n Ilya Shpitser says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 1, 2014 at 6:18 am \nPeople like to mock Less Wrong, saying we\u2019re amateurs getting all starry-eyed about Bayesian statistics even while real hard-headed researchers who have been experts in them for years understand both their uses and their limitations.

As a practicing frequentist statistician, I am certain.  Also, this is one of the few times that I actually agree with Eliezer Yudkowsky!  He commented on your post. Substitute \u201cfrequentist\u201d for Bayes, and vice-versa, in his comment. The conclusion is the same, in my informed opinion: meta-analyses are less, rather than more, ah, robust, compared to some of the other pyramid levels.\nI mention this with good intent (it isn\u2019t like a tiny missing word). You said,\nThere is broad agreement among the most intelligent voices I read (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) about a couple of promising directions we could go.\nNo, noooo! Number 3 is notorious science fraud, Jonah Lehrer. Lehrer acknowledged that he fabricated or plagiarized everything. He even gave a lecture about it at a prominent journalism school, maybe Columbia or Knight or NYU, last year, after being found out. You should probably re-think whether you want to cite him as one of the most intelligent voices you read.\nUnlike most critiques of statistical analysis, yours does contain a core of truth!\nPeople are terrible. If you let people debate things, they will do it forever, come up with horrible ideas, get them entrenched, play politics with them, and finally reach the point where they\u2019re coming up with theories why people who disagree with them are probably secretly in the pay of the Devil.\nI enjoyed that, very much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scott Alexander says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 4, 2014 at 9:04 pm \nI think you\u2019re misunderstanding.

They are not the highest level of the scientific pyramid\u2026When I read about a new meta-analysis I mostly roll my eyes.\nMe too!\nI don\u2019t know what this is about,\n\u201cYou can\u2019t multiply a bunch of likelihood functions and get what a real Bayesian would consider zero everywhere, and from this extract a verdict by the dark magic of frequentist statistics.\u201d\nWhen I make my magical midnight invocations to the dark deities of frequentist statistics, open my heart and mind to the spirits of Neyman, Pearson and Fisher, I work with maximum likelihood estimates (MLE\u2019s), not \u201clikelihood functions\u201d.

On a calculational level, this is all that happens, and indeed Scott\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t break from this. However, when it comes to the actual inference, what should happen is more than this; ideally, we should allow our beliefs to be guided by what those numbers actually represent. Because Scott uses two priors, however, the relative odds of his two competing hypotheses (i.e. there is a true effect and there is not) remains the same before and after any particular statistical test of the evidence. Something about this is just not right, IMO.\nIn practice, I know that it is nonsense to believe what the numbers literally say, without skepticism. People should only take statistics at face-value, for areas that really intrigue them, after having satisfied themselves thoroughly that the experiments under analysis are not explainable on the basis of flaws. But after this has occurred, those numbers have real meaning!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Anonymous says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 5, 2014 at 2:40 pm \n@Johann:\nI don\u2019t think you understand me clearly\nActually your new post confirms that I did understand you, and that you don\u2019t understand how Bayesian updating works.\n[W]e can update a prior to a posterior, by multiplication with a Bayes factor. On a calculational level, this is all that happens, and indeed Scott\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t break from this.\nIn fact the approach Scott proposed for updating his probabilities was dead wrong, because he made the contribution from the new evidence depend on the prior, which violates one tenet of Bayesian inference; and using his method of updating, his posterior probability for psi can never exceed 1\/2, which violates another tenet of Bayesian inference.\nBecause Scott uses two priors, however, the relative odds of his two competing hypotheses (i.e. there is a true effect and there is not) remains the same before and after any particular statistical test of the evidence. Something about this is just not right, IMO.\nBayesian inference always considers (at least) two hypotheses.  Often, the second hypothesis is the complement of the first, but this need not be the case.   It is perfectly fine to consider the prior odds of an observed effect being due to psi (H1) vs  being due to experimental bias (H2).  The prior odds is a ratio of two probabilities, P(H1)\/P(H2), and is hence a single non-negative number.  This number is multiplied by the Bayes factor, which is the ratio of the probability of the data under the psi hypothesis to the probability of the data under the bias hypothesis, and is hence also a non-negative number.  Unless this number is 1, or the prior odds 0 or infinity, then multiplying the prior odds by the Bayes factor will result in posterior odds that are different than the prior odds.  Clearly, the odds will not remain the same, as you claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Johann says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 6, 2014 at 12:50 am \nIt may well be that I am technically mistaken in my analysis\u2014I have not deeply studied Bayesian hypothesis testing\u2014but my impression is still that we\u2019re not actually disagreeing on much, although now I have a concern or two about your approach as well. I would be glad to be corrected on any mistake, BTW.\nFirstly, I will be as clear as possible about what I mean. I see Scott\u2019s approach as one that conducts two separate hypothesis tests, both correctly performed. My contention, though, is that it is fundamentally wrong to do *both*. It is clear to me that Scott is juggling four subtle hypotheses, when really he\u2019s only interested in two, to start with: psi exists vs. it does not, and invalidating flaws exist vs. they do not. He sets his prior for flaws at 1\/10 (implying a prior of 9\/10 for no invalidating flaws) and his prior for psi at 1\/1000 (implying a prior of 999\/1000 for no psi), multiplies both of them by the Bayes factor of a study, let\u2019s say 300, and obtains two posterior distributions, let\u2019s say 30 to 1 for flaws vs. no flaws and 3 to 10 for psi vs. no psi.\nNow, since the existence of invalidating flaws effectively begets the same conclusion as the non-existence of psi, we can make the following comparison: At the start of the test, the ratio of Scott\u2019s two priors was (1\/10)\/(1\/1000) = 100\/1, implying that he favored the flaws hypothesis a hundred times more than the psi hypothesis. Now, the ratio for his posteriors is (30\/1)\/(3\/10) = 100\/1, so it is clear that nothing has changed and the very performance of the test was meaningless.

If D stands for our observed data (in this case, the results of the experiments in the meta-analysis), then\nBayes\u2019 factor = P(D|H1)\/P(D|H2) = 300.\nAnd, by the odds form of Bayes\u2019 theorem, we multiply the prior odds by the Bayes\u2019 factor to obtain the posterior odds of H1 vs H2:\nPosterior odds = P(H1|D)\/P(H2|D) = 300 \u00d7 .0001 = .03 .\nSo, prior to observing the data, we believed that results purporting to show psi were 10,000 times as likely to be due to bias than to psi.  After observing the data, we believe that results purporting to show psi are only 33 (=1\/.03) times as likely to be due to bias than to psi.  Our new observations have increased our belief that the results are due to psi relative to our belief that they are due to bias by a factor of 300.\nHopefully that makes sense to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Julio Siqueira says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 4, 2014 at 9:17 pm \nHi Scott,\nI must say that I am sort of a \u201cbeliever in psi.\u201d Also, I have read pretty much about it over the last ten years, and I have been following to a certain extent the psi-believers vs psi-skeptics debate (on the web, in papers, in books, like \u201cPsi Wars: Getting to Grips with the Paranormal,\u201d etc). Further, I have, on some occasions, taken sides rather fiercely on this issue. Yet, I must acknowledge that many critiques of psi works are of high value. And I did find your evaluation (article) above very interesting and worthy of respect. I would like to comment on a few points:\n\u201cNone of these five techniques even touch poor experimental technique \u2013 or confounding, or whatever you want to call it. If an experiment is confounded, if it produces a strong signal even when its experimental hypothesis is true, then using a larger sample size will just make that signal even stronger.\u201d \u2026 \u2026 \u201cReplicating it will just reproduce the confounded results again.\u201d\nI believe that, if only confounding were involved in the issue, there actually would be a drifting in the results, and not confirmation plus confirmation plus confirmation. It would take more than poor standards to veer the results in one direction: it would take some sort of fraud, at least either conscious or unconscious.\nAnd, the results in the Wiseman and Schlitz\u2019s work was interesting. It is curious that it was not heavily replicated (It might be interesting to find out if it was mostly because of the believers or because of the skeptics\u2026).\nI just would like to add, as gentlemanly as possible (and thus, honour the high level of the debate on this page), that I do not share your view regarding Wiseman. But, that is not the issue, anyway.\nI also think that Johann made very good contributions to the debate on this page. It is nice that he provided a fair amount of information about quantum mechanics\u2019 based biological phenomena, which is an area of knowledge that has been increasing considerably (and robustly) over the last ten years.\nJulio Siqueira\nhttp:\/\/www.criticandokardec.com.br\/criticizingskepticism.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPingback: The Bem Precognition Meta-Analysis Vs.

He found effect sizes of anywhere from 0.15 to 1.7, depending on the type of experiment involved. Note that this could also be phrased as \u201cbetween twice as strong and twenty times as strong as Bem\u2019s psi effect\u201d. Mysteriously, animal learning experiments displayed the highest effect size, supporting the folk belief that animals are hypersensitive to subtle emotional cues.\nI agree the Rosenthal results are interesting, but I think the Pygmalion effect is more likely to be an example of violating the commandments & statistical malpractice (Rosental also gave us the \u2018fail-safe N\u2019\u2026) than subtle experimenter effects influencing the actual results; see Jussim & Harber 2005, \u201cTeacher Expectations and Self-Fulfilling Prophecies: Knowns and Unknowns, Resolved and Unresolved Controversies\u201d http:\/\/www.rci.rutgers.edu\/~jussim\/Teacher%20Expectations%20PSPR%202005.pdf\nBut first of all, I\u2019m pretty sure no one does double-blind studies with rats.\nNot really.

But, bizarrely, Bem et al, set the value to .001, actually assuming that the unpublished studies support the psi hypothesis!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n gwern says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 6, 2014 at 8:26 pm \nRosenthal\u2019s fail-safe N should never be used, but not because it assumes that publication bias does not exist, but because it is based on the unrealistic assumption that the mean effect size in the unpublished studies is 0.

For example, the \u201cphysics\u201d that almost everybody would point out as being \u201cexotic\u201d, namely Quantum Mechanics, is actually far more ubiquitous even than the Almighty Omnipresent Holy Lord Himself ! (if He exists). \nThen you add that \u201cthe amount of clearly visible wiring and genes and brain areas\u201d\u2026  \u2026\u201cis obvious to *everyone* \u201d\u2026 \u2026\u201cfrom anatomists (\u2026) to molecular biologists (\u2026) to JUST ANYBODY WHO LOOKS AT (\u2026) eyes.\u201d (emphasis added). And as a consequence, you expect similar *obvious* correlates. I think we have to remember that even almighty stuff isn\u2019t always (surprisingly enough) obviously \u201cperceptible.\u201d Especially when some sort of canceling out is at play. For example, we all know that electromagnetic force is pretty much almighty (far mightier than gravity; and gravity is not exactly a light weight\u2026 \u2013 pun intended). Yet, were it not for lightening bolts, even fairly advanced human societies might have passed it by completely, without an inkling of perception of it. See, we have *obvious* physical apparatus for dealing with air (lungs; the inhaling process; exhaling; etc), with water or somewhat solid matter (mouth, teeth, stomach, etc), with visible light (eyes), with sound (ears), etc. But unlike electric fish, we do not have *obvious* biological machinery to deal with \u201clightening stuff.\u201d Yet, not only is \u201celectricity\u201d itself immensely present in our biological machinery (i.e. even we, humans, take huge advantage of it), electromagnetism actually knits reality tight; and without it, matter would wander astray (even atoms would fall apart). What recent biology is telling us about biological uses of quantum phenomena is that it seems that we don\u2019t have any *obvious* correlate to it in terms of biological machinery. Yet, the correlates that we do have are not only ubiquitous but essential for life. Enzymes work taking advantage of quantum tunneling. Photosynthesis, if my mind serves me well, takes advantage of quantum entanglement. And when I say \u201ctake advantage\u201d, what I mean is: cannot do without! So, yes, it is speculative and even unlikely, but\u2026 it might just be that the correlates are there. It is just us that cannot see them yet.\nAnd next you add: \u201cThere\u2019s also the question of how we could spend so much evolutionary effort exploiting weird physics to evolve a faculty that doesn\u2019t even really work.\u201d, and you remind us that psi won\u2019t give us a head start greater than five percent over chance (as it seems; Ganzfeld), and then you mention its (apparent) absence in our ordinary lives, and the possible paradoxes of precognition (short and\/or long term). Well, what might be happening (if psi exists\u2026) is that we are not really looking at *how* psi works and at *what for* psi works. For example, electromagnetism does not exist for making lightening\u2026 Lightening bolts are just minor manifestations of the greater phenomenon of electromagnetism. They are almost \u201cspin offs.\u201d The basic and \u201ctrue\u201d function of electromagnetism in Nature is to knit reality together (Especially protons and electrons \u201cdirectly\u201d, as happens in atoms. And, oddly enough, as a consequence of this knitting, electromagnetism becomes pretty much\u2026 hidden!). So maybe the function of psi (i.e. the *main* function of it in Nature) is not to get humans synched in telepathy or forewarned in precognition or \u201cphysically\u201d unencumbered in telekinesis. These might actually be lesser deities, when instead we should rather look for the Big Guy.  \ud83d\ude42 \nFinally you say something like: \u201cWeird Physics + Invisible Organ-less Non-adaptive-fitness-providing Mechanisms x Precognition x Telepathy x Telekinesis.\u201d Parapsychology does have problems\u2026 Admittedly, even according to psi researchers who believe in psi, two chief problems are, 1: possible theories for the paranormal and, 2: the role of the paranormal in Nature. We have been very clumsy in tackling these issues, IMHO. (Note that I am not a psi researcher. I am just considering these issues to be a concern of us all, no matter where we stand regarding it). So we are pretty much in the dark trying to make sense out of something that almost everybody agrees that\u2026 may not even exist! But since we (i.e. some of us) *are* trying to make sense out of it, one possibility (aside from the alternatives offered by Scott: poor studies, biased researchers, weird combinations of the two previous alternatives, etc) that comes to my mind when I look at the apparent anomaly in the Ganzfeld database (or when I look at Bem\u2019s results now) is that this anomaly is a very \u201cintentional\u201d phenomenon. What I mean is that: even if you can control electronic devices with the electricity from your neurons (something that we now can routinely accomplish), it takes a lot of practice and \u201cinformative feedback\u201d for you to learn how to master it. Yet, when it comes to shifting the odds in the desired direction in Ganzfeld sessions, we seem to be naturals in that\u2026 I think the only biological conclusion that can be drawn from it is that, if psi exists, we all use it routinely. But\u2026 maybe we do not use it for the things most people (including almost all parapsychology researchers) believe it is used for.\nAnyway, just thoughts\u2026\nBest Wishes,\nJulio Siqueira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Nancy Lebovitz says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 6, 2014 at 10:59 pm \nSo far as the Invisible Organ is concerned, if we don\u2019t know how psi works, how likely would we be to recognize an organ for it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Julio Siqueira says: \n\n\t\t\tMay 7, 2014 at 9:37 am \nHi Nancy,\nThat is really an impediment.

A couple of other observations. My father was a process development engineer at Dow Chemical. His design work in this area was to take a research result and test it\u2019s commercial viability in a sizable plant process, a kind of enhanced replication. Researchers thought this was grunt work (the persistent attitude toward replication), and that all that was required was to make what they did in the laboratory bigger. But when you increase the size of a process by 5-7 orders of magnitude, a great many things become different. The lesson is that it isn\u2019t always clear which changes in experimental conditions are important to the outcome, and the opinion of the researcher is a poor guide.\nThe second observation is from an article I read from the late 70-80s. It was a test of the hypothesis that niacin in large doses reduced the symptoms of schizophrenia. The design was double blind and the people who evaluated the improvement didn\u2019t know who was receiving the niacin. However, the waiting room for the people being evaluated would hold 4-5 people at a time. Naturally they talked, and because of the niacin flush, they quickly figured out who was on placebo. It was, incidentally easy to figure out what the drug was, too. The conclusion was that one-third of the people on placebo broke the blind and went out and bought niacin. No one told the researchers because there were incentives for not telling the blind had been broken. Experimental conditions includes everything, not just what the researcher thinks is critical to successful publication.\nAlso, there is some evidence that placebos work even when people know they are placebos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solo Atkinson says: \n\n\t\t\tJanuary 13, 2016 at 10:57 am \nA well-known example of this phenomenon is the development of the Haber-Bosch nitrogen fixation process.

The illogic is stunning.

No ifs, ands or buts. Possible bias by researchers has to be taken into account when considering their results, and when they themselves formulate their experiments \u2013 in any scientific research. \nHowever, it is ridiculous to assert that because you personally don\u2019t believe in something anyone trying to determine whether there is a way to scientifically measure and validate alleged phenomenon is automatically wrong.\nThis is a very worrying thought pattern I see from \u2018skeptics\u2019 all the time. It is not skepticism at all, it is a kneejerk response to things that threaten their personal world view and belief system. By this definition 99% of the people on the planet are \u2018skeptics\u2019, and the only genuine skeptics are those prepared to challenge their own world views.\nI\u2019m concerned that someone could actually take that statement seriously, so, allow me to assert that to actually prove that a group of researchers science is wrong, you actually have to go into their methodology and conclusions and find errors.

In particular, we expect the students to have taken an introductory computer science course that goes beyond basic computer programming and covers algorithmic thinking. On the mathematics side, we expect the students to have experience reasoning abstractly and know how to write formal proofs.\n      \nLearning Objectives\n\n      Broadly speaking, the course has several goals. First, it provides a rigorous\/formal introduction to the foundations of computer science, which is the science that studies computation in all its generality. An important component of this is improving your analytic and abstract thinking skills since nature's language is mathematics. Second, the course intends to prepare you to be innovators in computer science by presenting some of the great ideas that people in the past have contributed to science and humanity. We hope that you will learn from their examples. Third, the course gives you opportunities to improve your social skills by emphasizing cooperation, clarity of thought, and clarity in the expression of thought.  \n      \n\n      More specifically, some of the main learning objectives are the following.\n      \n Define mathematically the notions of computation, computational problem, and algorithm.\n         Express, analyze and compare the computability and computational complexity of problems.\n         Use mathematical tools from set theory, combinatorics, graph theory, probability theory, and number theory in the study of computability, computational complexity, and some of the real-world applications of computational concepts.\n         State and explain the important and well-known open problems in the theory of computation.\n         Write clearly presented proofs that meet rigorous standards of correctness and conventional guidelines on style.\n         Identify and critique proofs that are logically flawed and\/or do not meet the expected standards of clarity.\n         Cooperate with other people in order to solve challenging and rigorous problems related to the study of computer science.\n      \n\n\n      Note that even though all of the topics we discuss in the course have real-world applications, often we will not be explicitly discussing the applications. This is because initially it is better to separate concerns regarding real-world applications from the exploration of fundamental truths and knowledge that shape how we view and understand the world. The quest for truth and understanding, wherever it takes us, eventually do produce applications, some that we hoped to achieve, and some that were beyond our wildest dreams. The focus of the course is on that quest for truth and understanding, which is arguably more important than specific applications.  \n      \nExternal Resources\n\n      There is no required textbook for the course. The material is fairly diverse, and no standard text contains it. Lecture notes will be provided. Furthermore, the lectures will be recorded and the links to the video recordings as well as the slide handouts will be provided on the course website.\n      \n\n      If you want to look at books which contain parts of the course material, we recommend the following:\n      \n\n\n Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser,\n         The Nature of Computation by Cristopher Moore and Stephan Mertens,\n         Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science by Boaz Barak,\n         Quantum Computing Since Democritus  by Scott Aaronson.\n      \n\nMentoring System\n\n      You will all be assigned a mentor TA at the beginning of the semester. Your mentor will keep track of your progress, grade your homeworks, and help you do well in the course. Don't hesitate to contact your mentor TA about anything related to the course. For instance, you can set up meetings with you mentor TA to review course material, go over homeworks or exams, or chat about studying strategies.\n      \n\n      Throughout the semester, feel free to reach out to anyone on the course staff about anything. We are here to help you anyway we can!\n      \nGrading\n\n      Your grade will depend on the following factors.\n      \n\nHomeworks. There are 10 homework assignments.\n      \n\nMidterm Exams. There are 3 Midterm exams (Sep 18 from 9:00am to 10:20am, Oct 10 from 6:30pm to 9:30pm, and Nov 7 from 6:30pm to 9:30pm). Please mark your calendars. The first midterm is an early midterm and has half the weight of other exams. The purpose of this exam is to give you early feedback and give you a chance to adjust your approach to the course if needed.\n      \n\nFinal Exam. There is a Final exam at the end of the semester during the finals week.\n      \n\nClass Participation. This is based on attendance in lectures and recitations, as well as completion of weekly online quizzes.\n      \n\n      Your numerical grade will be calculated according to the following table.\n      \n\n\n\nCourse Component\nWeight\n\n\nHomework\n25%\n\n\nMidterm 1\n10%\n\n\nMidterm 2\n20%\n\n\nMidterm 3\n20%\n\n\nFinal\n20%\n\n\nParticipation\n5%\n\n\n\n\n      At mid-semester, letter grade cut-offs will be announced.\n      \n\nHomework System\n\n      Homework is an extremely important component of the course and is the main tool we use to teach you valuable skills, reinforce key concepts, and help you learn the material.\n      \n\n      There are some general rules that apply to all the questions in the homework:\n      \n You cannot share written material with anyone.\n         You cannot discuss solutions to the problems on any discussion forum.\n         You cannot solicit answers to the homework questions, i.e., you cannot ask anyone to provide you the solution to a problem, before the homework writing session.\n         Searching the internet for general concepts is allowed. Googling for specific keywords that happen to appear in one of the homework questions is prohibited.\n         You must always cite your sources including the people you have worked with.\n         For the collaborative portions of the homework, you must think about a problem for 15 minutes before you start discussing it with someone else.\n         If you work on a publicly visible whiteboard\/blackboard, you must erase all contents when you are done.\n      \n      If you have any doubts about whether something is within the rules or not, do not hesitate to contact the course staff.\n      \n\nTypes of questions: There will be 4 types of questions in the homework and each question will be clearly labeled with its type.\n      \n\n      SOLO - You must work on these questions by yourself. In addition to the rules mentioned above, you are not allowed to discuss these questions with anyone except for the course staff.\n      \n\n      GROUP - These questions must be solved in groups of 3 or 4. Working on these questions just by yourself is not allowed! You must clearly indicate your group members. You can change your group from week to week, but you can have at most one group per week. Other than your group members, you may discuss these questions with the course staff.\n      \n\n      OPEN COLLABORATION - You can discuss these questions with anyone you like from class (i.e., other students currently taking the course and the course staff). Other than the general rules stated above, there are no additional rules for this type of question.\n      \n\n      PROGRAMMING - Not all homework assignments will contain a programming question, but some might. The SOLO rules apply to these types of questions. You must submit your programs to Autolab by 6:30pm the day the homework is due.\n      \n\n      A homework assignment for a particular week will contain SOLO and\/or PROGRAMMING type questions covering the current week's material, plus, GROUP and\/or OPEN type questions covering the previous week's material. This has a couple of benefits. First, you'll solve problems on a topic for two weeks rather than one, which helps with retention. Second, after solving the easier solo questions, you will be much better prepared to solve the harder collaborative questions.\n      \n\nHomework writing sessions: You will not hand in written up solutions to every question of the homework. Every Wednesday from 6:30pm to 7:50pm at DH 2315, we will have a homework writing session. We will randomly pick a subset of the homework questions (usually 3 questions are picked), and you will be required to write the solutions to those problems individually during this proctored setting. We expect that you will have already practiced writing down the solution to every question in the homework prior to Wednesday night. Therefore these homework writing sessions should be relatively straightforward and stress-free.\n      \n\nHomework grading: After the homework writing session, you will get back your graded homework the following recitation. The rubrics that we used to grade each question will be posted on Diderot. You will know who graded which question. Whenever there is a point deduction on your homework, an explanation should be given, but if you do not understand why you lost points, please don't hesitate to contact us so we can clarify things for you.\n      \n\n      Grading proofs is a complicated process. We try our best to be as fair and as consistent as possible. However, mistakes will happen from time to time. Therefore we have a system in place that makes grading a two-step process. The first step is that we read your solutions and assign an initial grade based on the rubric. The second step is that you carefully review the rubric and your solution, and if you have any disagreement with the number of points you got, you email the TA who graded that question. If there was a mistake, we'll correct it. If you cannot resolve the situation with the TA who graded the question, email one of the head TAs to get a second opinion. If you are still not satisfied, email one of the instructors.\n      \n\n      Note that your grade can never go down as a result of a regrade request; it can only go up.\n      \n\n      The deadline for homework regrade request is Wednesday 6:30pm (one week after the corresponding homework writing session). Email your request to the TA who graded the question. \n      \n\nHomework resubmission: It is very important that you learn from your mistakes and correct them. For this reason, after you get your graded homework back, you will be allowed to resubmit solutions that you have gotten wrong. You may (and should) go to the homework solution sessions (see below for details) or ask about the solution during office hours. If you turn in a completely correct and well-written solution, you will receive back 50% of the lost credit for that question. If on the other hand your solution is not near-perfect, then unfortunatly you will not receive any points back.\n      \n\n      The deadline for homework solution resubmission is Sunday 6:30pm (11 days after the corresponding homework writing session). Email your resubmission, along with your original solution, to the TA who graded that question.\n      \n\nProof-writing guidelines: The quality of your write-up and presentation matters a lot, so you should make sure your solutions are very clearly explained. If you are not sure of something, or you think there is a gap in your argument, clearly indicate these in your write-up (you will earn more points doing so rather than writing a wrong argument!!). Do not try to sell a wrong or incomplete proof! If you leave a question completely blank, you will earn 20% of the credit for that question.\n      \n\n      To help you write correct and clear proofs, we have prepared a document with a list of guideline points. The guideline points will appear as a checklist in each homework. For each proof you write, you will have to tick the checklist items to acknowledge that you are following the guidelines.  \n      \n\nClick here to access the document.\n\n\nHomework solution sessions: Unfortunately, we will not be publishing written solutions to the homework problems. The main reason is that any homework solution we post kills the question for future semesters of the course (and any other course that might be using a similar question). Most questions we ask are pedagogically very valuable, and coming up with such questions is very hard. So we don't want to kill those questions by publishing solutions. That being said, we don't keep the solutions a secret either. We hold homework solution sessions twice a week and go over the solutions (on the blackboard) to the problems that appeared in the writing session. We are also always happy to go through the solutions to any problem with you during office hours. \n      \n\n      Note that during the solutions sessions, we will not write the full proof on the blackboard. We expect you to fill in the details yourself.\n      \n\n      The times and locations of the homework solution sessions will be announced at the beginning of the semester.\n      \nRecitation System\n\n      The recitation sections that you have signed up for on SIO will only be used for the first week of the course. Starting week 2, we will transition to a different system.\n      \n\n      One of the main advantages of recitations over lectures is that the sections are much smaller in size. In order to improve the student-TA ratio and give you more flexibility, we will be asking you the times you are available on Fridays and Saturdays. Based on that information, we will assign you to a recitation slot. And a typical recitation section will have about 12 students. \n      \n\n      In addition to the above change, we will offer 3 different spiciness levels for recitations. You will select yourself which level is appropriate for you. During the semester if you feel like you would like to switch to another level, let us know, and we'll arrange the switch.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBell pepper\n          Not spicy. We will go over the definitions to make sure everyone understands them fully. Then we will solve the problems together (as many as the time allows).\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJalape\u00f1o pepper\n          Normal spicy. After a quick review of definitions, we'll solve the problems together. These sections will have a faster pace.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabanero pepper\n          Hot! We'll assume you are comfortable with everything covered in lecture and notes, so we'll directly dive into the problems. These sections will have the fastest pace.\n        \n\n\n\n      We will take attendance in recitation. \n      \nDiderot\n\n      We will use Diderot for several purposes, as listed below. Every student is required to signup for the course's Diderot page!\n      \n\n Making announcements. Important announcements related to the course will be made on Diderot. You must check Diderot and\/or your email on a daily basis to receive the announcements in a timely manner.\n         Asking and answering questions. If you have a question about the course that can be easily answered electronically, please use Diderot.\n         Finding group members. You can use Diderot's \"Social\" posts to search and find group members to collaborate for the homework.\n         Conducting in-class polls. We will be asking poll questions during lectures related to the topics being discussed. We will give a link to the Google form containing the poll question through a Diderot post. We expect everyone to answer all the poll questions. We will not keep track of whether your answers are correct, however, we will use the polls to keep track of attendance. If a lecture contains multiple polls, a random one will be chosen to take attendance. If you experience a technical difficulty that prevents you from participating in a poll, then see the instructor right after lecture so your presence can be noted.\n         Publishing parts of course content. We plan to publish course notes, homeworks and recitations on Diderot.\n      \nAsking Questions\n\n      Even though we are always ready to help and provide support anyway we can, there is a fine balance that we have to respect. Ultimately, we would like you to develop the necessary skills to be self-sufficient problem solvers. You will have many questions throughout the semester. Reflecting on your questions to try to figure out the answers on your own is extremely valuable, and we want to make sure that you are not robbed of this experience. Here are some general guidelines for asking questions.\n      \n\n\n The general rule of thumb is the following. Before you ask a question to us, ask yourself whether you can figure out the answer yourself. If the answer is \"yes\" or \"maybe\", then you should give a solid effort in trying to find the answer. This is an extremely valuable learning experience.\n         Whenever you ask a question, first tell us what your own thoughts about the question are and what you have tried. If you don't, then we will usually respond to your question with another question asking you what your thoughts are. When you explain your thoughts to us, this allows us to see and fix any misunderstanding and help you more effectively.\n         If a homework problem is ambiguous to you, try to figure out all the possible interpretations and evaluate them one by one. Often, you'll find that there is really one interpretation that makes sense.\n         Try not to turn a conversation with a course staff member into the Twenty Questions game. This does not maximize your learning outcomes. Remember that when a question formulates in your mind, the first person who should try to answer it is you. Our role is to help you when you are stuck.\n         Certain discussions are best suited for your group. For example, if you want to bounce off ideas and get some feedback on your thought process for a GROUP or OPEN problem on the homework, you should have that conversation with your group members.\n         Please do not ask us to read your solution write-up and give you feedback on how many points you would get. Solutions can have subtle bugs, and we cannot always spot such bugs after a quick glance. Properly reading and evaluating a solution can take a lot of time. That being said, even though we cannot read your solution in detail before the homework writing session, we are happy to listen to your overall proof strategy and help you try to figure out if there are any logical flaws or gaps. \n         Diderot is a good resource for short-answer questions, but can be extremely inefficient for long-answer questions or questions that may require a back and forth conversation. When you want to ask a question on Diderot, consider whether the question is suitable for that platform, and if it is not, ask your question during office hours for a more useful and efficient conversation. \n      \n\nUse of Electronic Devices\n\n      The use of electronic devices like phones, tablets, and laptops during lectures and recitations is prohibited. These devices cause distractions both to you and the people around you. If you would like to use an electronic device to take notes and using paper and pencil is not a good option for you, please contact one of the instructors.\n      \n\n      There is an exception to the above rule. When we open up a poll during a lecture, you are allowed to use your phone to cast your vote. Once the poll is completed, you should put away your phone. If you do not have a smart phone, please contact one of the instructors.\n      \nHow to Succeed in 251\n\nDownload the pdf.\n      \nAcademic Integrity\n\n      We understand that most of you would never consider cheating in any form. There is, however, a small minority of students for whom this is not the case. In the past, when we have caught students cheating they have often insisted that they did not understand the rules and penalties. As a part of the first homework, you will be required to acknowledge that you have read and understood the cheating policies. Please read Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Academic Integrity. The following are some clear examples of cheating:\n      \n\n Copying from another student during an exam or homework writing session.\n       Discussing a SOLO problem before the homework writing session with someone who is not a part of the course staff.\n       Googling for specific keywords that happen to appear in one of the homework questions.\n       Showing a draft of a written solution to another student.\n       Getting help from someone who you do not acknowledge on your solution.\n       Receiving exam related information from a student who has already taken the exam.\n       Attempting to hack any part of the 15-251 infrastructure.\n       Looking at someone else\u2019s work on AFS, even if the file permissions allow it.\n       Lying to the course staff.\n    \n\nConsequences: The penalty for cheating can range from a 10% deduction on your overall course average (i.e. a letter grade drop) to directly failing the course. Furthermore, in most cases, a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs is sent and further consequences are determined by them.\n    \nExtended-Time and Make-Up Policy\n\n    We are happy to provide appropriate accommodations to students who have approval from the Disability Resources Center. Please contact one of the instructors if you are in this situation.\n    \n\n    No make-up quizzes, exams, or homework writing sessions will be administered, except in the case of documented medical or family emergencies, or other university approved absences. The common cold or your computer crashing, unfortunately, do not qualify as an excused absence.\n    \nWell-Being and Happiness\n\n    We very much care about your well-being and happiness! Be aware that everyone on the course staff is always available to provide counsel or chat, and you should attend office hours as often as you want for academic and non-academic conversation.\n    \n\n    However, also know that the university provides services that you may want to take advantage of at some point during the semester. If you are ever unsure about them, run into a problem, or want more information, feel free to reach out to the instructors.\n    \n\n    For a comprehensive list of CMU\u2019s resources, please click here.\n    \n\nCMU Police Department\n\n\n    Do not hesitate to call CMU police when in an emergency or if you are interested in taking advantage of their services.\n    \n\n Website: http:\/\/www.cmu.edu\/police\/welcome.html\n Emergency phone number: 412-268-2323\n       Non-Emergency phone number: 412-268-6232\n    \n\nCounseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\n\n\n    CAPS offer therapy, crisis support, etc. and you should reach out to CAPS for counseling if you are struggling, no matter how small you may think your problems are.

An op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion prob\u00adlem con\u00adsists of an ob\u00adjec\u00adtive func\u00adtion to be max\u00adi\u00admized or min\u00adi\u00admized, and a fea\u00adsi\u00adble re\u00adgion within which to search for a solu\u00adtion. For ex\u00adam\u00adple we might take the ob\u00adjec\u00adtive func\u00adtion (x2\u22122)2 as a min\u00adi\u00admiza\u00adtion prob\u00adlem and the whole real num\u00adber line as the fea\u00adsi\u00adble re\u00adgion. The solu\u00adtion then would be x=\u221a2 and a work\u00ading op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion al\u00adgorithm for this prob\u00adlem is one that out\u00adputs a close ap\u00adprox\u00adi\u00adma\u00adtion to this value.\nIn the field of op\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtions re\u00adsearch and en\u00adg\u00adineer\u00ading more broadly, op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion in\u00advolves im\u00adprov\u00ading some pro\u00adcess or phys\u00adi\u00adcal ar\u00adti\u00adfact so that it is fit for a cer\u00adtain pur\u00adpose or fulfills some set of re\u00adquire\u00adments. For ex\u00adam\u00adple, we might choose to mea\u00adsure a nail fac\u00adtory by the rate at which it out\u00adputs nails, rel\u00ada\u00adtive to the cost of pro\u00adduc\u00adtion in\u00adputs. We can view this as a kind of ob\u00adjec\u00adtive func\u00adtion, with the fac\u00adtory as the ob\u00adject of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion just as the vari\u00adable x was the ob\u00adject of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion in the pre\u00advi\u00adous ex\u00adam\u00adple.\nThere is clearly a con\u00adnec\u00adtion be\u00adtween op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading the fac\u00adtory and op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for x, but what ex\u00adactly is this con\u00adnec\u00adtion? What is it that iden\u00adti\u00adfies an al\u00adgorithm as an op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion al\u00adgorithm? What is it that iden\u00adti\u00adfies a pro\u00adcess as an op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion pro\u00adcess?\nThe an\u00adswer pro\u00adposed in this es\u00adsay is: an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem is a phys\u00adi\u00adcal pro\u00adcess in which the con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion of some part of the uni\u00adverse moves pre\u00addictably to\u00adwards a small set of tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions from any point in a broad basin of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion, de\u00adspite per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions dur\u00ading the op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion pro\u00adcess.\nWe do not imag\u00adine that there is some en\u00adg\u00adine or agent or mind perform\u00ading op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion, sep\u00ada\u00adrately from that which is be\u00ading op\u00adti\u00admized. We con\u00adsider the whole sys\u00adtem jointly \u2014 en\u00adg\u00adine and ob\u00adject of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion \u2014 and ask whether it ex\u00adhibits a ten\u00addency to evolve to\u00adwards a pre\u00addictable tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion. If so, then we call it an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem. If the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion is deep and wide then we say that this is a ro\u00adbust op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem.\nAn op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem as defined in this es\u00adsay is known in dy\u00adnam\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtems the\u00adory as a dy\u00adnam\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtem with one or more at\u00adtrac\u00adtors. In this es\u00adsay we show how this frame\u00adwork can help to un\u00adder\u00adstand op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion as man\u00adi\u00adfested in phys\u00adi\u00adcally closed sys\u00adtems con\u00adtain\u00ading both en\u00adg\u00adine and ob\u00adject of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion.\nIn this way we find that op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems are not some\u00adthing that are de\u00adsigned but are dis\u00adcov\u00adered. The con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion space of the world con\u00adtains countless pock\u00adets shaped like small and large bas\u00adins, such that if the world should crest the rim of one of these pock\u00adets then it will nat\u00adu\u00adrally evolve to\u00adwards the bot\u00adtom of the basin. We care about them be\u00adcause we can use our own agency to tip the world into such a basin and then let go, know\u00ading that from here on things will evolve to\u00adwards the tar\u00adget re\u00adgion.\nAll op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion bas\u00adins have a finite ex\u00adtent. A ball may roll to the cen\u00adter of a valley if ini\u00adtially placed any\u00adwhere within the valley, but if it is placed out\u00adside the valley then it will roll some\u00adwhere else en\u00adtirely, or per\u00adhaps will not roll at all. Similarly, even a very ro\u00adbust op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem has an outer rim to its basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion, such that if the con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion of the sys\u00adtem is per\u00adturbed be\u00adyond that rim then the sys\u00adtem no longer evolves to\u00adwards the tar\u00adget that it once did. When an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem de\u00advi\u00adates be\u00adyond its own rim, we say that it dies. An ex\u00adis\u00adten\u00adtial catas\u00adtro\u00adphe is when the op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem of life on Earth moves be\u00adyond its own outer rim.\nEx\u00adam\u00adple: com\u00adput\u00ading the square root of two\nSay I ask my com\u00adputer to com\u00adpute the square root of two, for ex\u00adam\u00adple by open\u00ading a python in\u00adter\u00adpreter and typ\u00ading:\n>>> print(math.sqrt(2))\n1.41421356237\n\nThe value printed here is ac\u00adtu\u00adally calcu\u00adlated by solv\u00ading an op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion prob\u00adlem. It works roughly as fol\u00adlows. First we set up an ob\u00adjec\u00adtive func\u00adtion that has as its min\u00adi\u00admum value the square root of two. One func\u00adtion we could use is y=(x2\u22122)2\n\nNext we pick an ini\u00adtial es\u00adti\u00admate for the square root of two, which can be any num\u00adber what\u00adso\u00adever. Let\u2019s take 1.0 as our ini\u00adtial guess. Then we take a gra\u00addi\u00adent step in the di\u00adrec\u00adtion in\u00addi\u00adcated by com\u00adput\u00ading the slope of the ob\u00adjec\u00adtive func\u00adtion at our ini\u00adtial es\u00adti\u00admate:\n\nThen we re\u00adpeat this pro\u00adcess of com\u00adput\u00ading the slope and up\u00addat\u00ading our es\u00adti\u00admate over and over, and our op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion al\u00adgorithm quickly con\u00adverges to the square root of two:\n\nThis is gra\u00addi\u00adent de\u00adscent, and it can be im\u00adple\u00admented in a few lines of python code:\n\tcurrent_estimate = 1.0\n\tstep_size = 1e-3\n\twhile True:\n\t\tobjective = (current_estimate**2 - 2) ** 2\n\t\tgradient = 4 * current_estimate * (current_estimate**2 - 2)\n\t\tif abs(gradient) < 1e-8:\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\tcurrent_estimate -= gradient * step_size\n\nBut this pro\u00adgram has the fol\u00adlow\u00ading un\u00adusual prop\u00aderty: we can mod\u00adify the vari\u00adable that holds the cur\u00adrent es\u00adti\u00admate of the square root of two at any point while the pro\u00adgram is run\u00adning, and the al\u00adgorithm will still con\u00adverge to the square root of two. That is, while the code above is run\u00adning, if I drop in with a de\u00adbug\u00adger and over\u00adwrite the cur\u00adrent es\u00adti\u00admate while the loop is still ex\u00ade\u00adcut\u00ading, what will hap\u00adpen is that the next gra\u00addi\u00adent step will start cor\u00adrect\u00ading for this per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion, push\u00ading the es\u00adti\u00admate back to\u00adwards the square root of two:\n\nIf we give the al\u00adgorithm time to con\u00adverge to within ma\u00adchine pre\u00adci\u00adsion of the ac\u00adtual square root of two then the fi\u00adnal out\u00adput will be bit-for-bit iden\u00adti\u00adcal to the re\u00adsult we would have got\u00adten with\u00adout the per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion.\nCon\u00adsider this for a mo\u00adment. For most kinds of com\u00adputer code, over\u00adwrit\u00ading a vari\u00adable while the code is run\u00adning will ei\u00adther have no effect be\u00adcause the vari\u00adable isn\u2019t used, or it will have a catas\u00adtrophic effect and the code will crash, or it will sim\u00adply cause the code to out\u00adput the wrong an\u00adswer. If I use a de\u00adbug\u00adger to drop in on a web\u00adserver ser\u00advic\u00ading an http re\u00adquest and I over\u00adwrite some vari\u00adable with an ar\u00adbi\u00adtrary value just as the code is perform\u00ading a loop in which this vari\u00adable is used in a cen\u00adtral way, bad things are likely to hap\u00adpen! Most com\u00adputer code is not ro\u00adbust to ar\u00adbi\u00adtrary in-flight data mod\u00adifi\u00adca\u00adtions.\nBut this code that com\u00adputes the square root of two is ro\u00adbust to in-flight data mod\u00adifi\u00adca\u00adtions, or at least the \u201ccur\u00adrent es\u00adti\u00admate\u201d vari\u00adable is. It\u2019s not that our per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion has no effect: if we change the value, the next iter\u00ada\u00adtion of the al\u00adgorithm will com\u00adpute the ob\u00adjec\u00adtive func\u00adtion and its slope at a com\u00adpletely differ\u00adent point, and each iter\u00ada\u00adtion af\u00adter that will be differ\u00adent to how it would have been if we hadn\u2019t in\u00adter\u00advened. The per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion may change the to\u00adtal num\u00adber of iter\u00ada\u00adtions be\u00adfore con\u00adver\u00adgence is reached. But ul\u00adti\u00admately the al\u00adgorithm will still out\u00adput an es\u00adti\u00admate of the square root of two, and, given time to fully con\u00adverge, it will out\u00adput the ex\u00adact same an\u00adswer it would have out\u00adput with\u00adout the per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion. This is an un\u00adusual breed of com\u00adputer pro\u00adgram in\u00addeed!\nWhat is hap\u00adpen\u00ading here is that we have con\u00adstructed a phys\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtem con\u00adsist\u00ading of a com\u00adputer and a python pro\u00adgram that com\u00adputes the square root of two, such that:\n\nfor a set of start\u00ading con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions (in this case the set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions in which the \u201ccur\u00adrent es\u00adti\u00admate\u201d vari\u00adable is set to each rep\u00adre\u00adsentable float\u00ading point num\u00adber),\n\nthe sys\u00adtem ex\u00adhibits a ten\u00addency to evolve to\u00adwards a small set of tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions (in this case just the sin\u00adgle con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion in which the \u201ccur\u00adrent es\u00adti\u00admate\u201d vari\u00adable is set to the square root of two),\n\nand this ten\u00addency is ro\u00adbust to in-flight per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions to the sys\u00adtem\u2019s con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion (in this case ro\u00adbust\u00adness is limited to just the di\u00admen\u00adsions cor\u00adre\u00adspond\u00ading to changes in the \u201ccur\u00adrent es\u00adti\u00admate\u201d vari\u00adable).\n\nIn this es\u00adsay I ar\u00adgue that sys\u00adtems that con\u00adverge to some tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion, and will do so de\u00adspite per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions to the sys\u00adtem, are the sys\u00adtems we should rightly call \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems\u201d.\nEx\u00adam\u00adple: build\u00ading a house\nCon\u00adsider a group of hu\u00admans build\u00ading a house.

If I pick up my dog while he is sleep\u00ading and move him by a few inches, he still finds his way to his wa\u00adter bowl when he wakes up.

We could also make phys\u00adi\u00adcally micro\u00adscopic per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions to this sys\u00adtem that change the robot\u2019s goal. For ex\u00adam\u00adple we might flip the sign on some crit\u00adi\u00adcal com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtions in the robot\u2019s code such that the robot works to place the ball at the high\u00adest point rather than the low\u00adest.

A tree has a ten\u00addency to grow taller over time, to sprout more branches and leaves, and so on. Fur\u00adther\u00admore, trees can only grow so tall due to the physics of trans\u00adport\u00ading sug\u00adars up and down the trunk. So we can iden\u00adtify a set of tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions in which the atoms in our re\u00adgion of space are ar\u00adranged into a tree that has grown to its max\u00adi\u00admum size (has sprouted as many branches and leaves as it can sup\u00adport given the at\u00admo\u00adsphere, the soil that it is grow\u00ading in, and the con\u00adstraints of its own biol\u00adogy). There are many topolo\u00adgies in which the tree\u2019s branches could di\u00advide, many po\u00adsi\u00adtions that leaves could sprout in, and so on, so there are many con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions within the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set.

Start\u00ading from any of these con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions, if we leave the sys\u00adtem to evolve un\u00adder the nat\u00adu\u00adral laws of physics then the tree will grow to\u00adwards its max\u00adi\u00admum size, at which point the sys\u00adtem will be in one of the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions.\nRo\u00adbust\u00adness to per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions.

There are no man-made sys\u00adtems in ex\u00adis\u00adtence to\u00adday that are ca\u00adpa\u00adble of gath\u00ader\u00ading and uti\u00adliz\u00ading re\u00adsources so flex\u00adibly as a tree, from so broad a va\u00adri\u00adety of en\u00advi\u00adron\u00adments, and there are cer\u00adtainly no man-made sys\u00adtems that can re\u00adcover from be\u00ading phys\u00adi\u00adcally dis\u00admem\u00adbered to such an ex\u00adtent that a tree can re\u00adcover from be\u00ading cut at the trunk.\nAt this point it may be tempt\u00ading to say that the en\u00adg\u00adine of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion is nat\u00adu\u00adral se\u00adlec\u00adtion. But re\u00adcall that we are study\u00ading just a sin\u00adgle tree grow\u00ading from seed to max\u00adi\u00admum size.

Nat\u00adu\u00adral se\u00adlec\u00adtion might be the pro\u00adcess by which the ini\u00adtial sys\u00adtem came into ex\u00adis\u00adtence, but it is not the pro\u00adcess that drives the growth of the tree to\u00adwards a tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion.\nIt may then be tempt\u00ading to say that it is the tree\u2019s DNA that is the en\u00adg\u00adine of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion. It is true that the tree\u2019s DNA ex\u00adhibits some char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adis\u00adtics of an en\u00adg\u00adine of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion: it re\u00admains un\u00adchanged through\u00adout the life of the tree, and phys\u00adi\u00adcally micro\u00adscopic per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions to it can dis\u00adable the tree. But a tree repli\u00adcates its DNA in each of its cells, and per\u00adturb\u00ading just one or a small num\u00adber of these is not likely to af\u00adfect the tree\u2019s over\u00adall growth tra\u00adjec\u00adtory. More im\u00adpor\u00adtantly, a sin\u00adgle strand of DNA does not re\u00adally have agency on its own: it re\u00adquires the molec\u00adu\u00adlar ma\u00adchin\u00adery of the whole cell to syn\u00adthe\u00adsize pro\u00adteins based on the ge\u00adnetic code in the DNA, and the phys\u00adi\u00adcal ma\u00adchin\u00adery of the whole tree to col\u00adlect and de\u00adploy en\u00adergy, wa\u00adter, and nu\u00adtri\u00adents.

A tree sim\u00adply does not de\u00adcom\u00adpose into en\u00adg\u00adine and ob\u00adject of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion.\nIt may also be tempt\u00ading to ask whether the tree can \u201cre\u00adally\u201d be said to be un\u00adder\u00adgo\u00ading op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion in the ab\u00adsence of any \u201cin\u00adten\u00adtion\u201d to reach one of the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions.

But this turns out to be mis\u00adguided on two counts: first, the vast ma\u00adjor\u00adity of op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems do not con\u00adtain cen\u00adtral\u00adized minds, and sec\u00adond, our own minds are ac\u00adtu\u00adally far less cen\u00adtral\u00adized than we think! For now we put this ques\u00adtion of whether op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion re\u00adquires in\u00adten\u00adtions and in\u00adstead just work within our defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems, which a tree definitely satis\u00adfies.\nEx\u00adam\u00adple: bot\u00adtle cap\nDaniel Filan has pointed out that some defi\u00adni\u00adtions of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion would non\u00adsen\u00adsi\u00adcally clas\u00adsify a bot\u00adtle cap as an op\u00adti\u00admizer, since a bot\u00adtle cap causes wa\u00adter molecules in a bot\u00adtle to stay in\u00adside the bot\u00adtle, and the set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions in which the molecules are in\u00adside a bot\u00adtle is much smaller than the set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions in which the molecules are each al\u00adlowed to take a po\u00adsi\u00adtion ei\u00adther in\u00adside or out\u00adside the bot\u00adtle.\nIn our frame\u00adwork we have the fol\u00adlow\u00ading:\n\nThe sys\u00adtem con\u00adsists of a bot\u00adtle, a bot\u00adtle cap, and wa\u00adter molecules.

This is no differ\u00adent from a rock sit\u00adting on a beach: due to ba\u00adsic chem\u00adistry there is a ten\u00addency to re\u00admain within the set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions in which the molecules com\u00adpris\u00ading the rock are phys\u00adi\u00adcally bound to one an\u00adother, but it has no ten\u00addency to evolve from a wide basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion to\u00adwards a small set of tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion.\nSe\u00adcond, the bot\u00adtle cap sys\u00adtem is not ro\u00adbust to per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions since if we per\u00adturb the po\u00adsi\u00adtion of a sin\u00adgle wa\u00adter molecule so that it is out\u00adside the bot\u00adtle, there is no ten\u00addency for it to move back in\u00adside the bot\u00adtle.

Sup\u00adpose we ob\u00adserve a hu\u00adman work\u00ading to make money. If this per\u00adson were de\u00adprived of a liver, or if their liver stopped func\u00adtion\u00ading, they would pre\u00adsum\u00adably be un\u00adable to make money. So are we then to view the liver as an op\u00adti\u00admizer work\u00ading to\u00adwards the goal of mak\u00ading money? Filan asks this ques\u00adtion as a challenge to Yud\u00adkowsky\u2019s defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion, since it seems ab\u00adsurd to view one\u2019s liver as an op\u00adti\u00admizer work\u00ading to\u00adwards the goal of mak\u00ading money, yet Yud\u00adkowsky\u2019s defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion might clas\u00adsify it as such.\nIn our frame\u00adwork we have the fol\u00adlow\u00ading:\n\nThe sys\u00adtem con\u00adsists of a hu\u00adman work\u00ading to make money, to\u00adgether with the whole hu\u00adman econ\u00adomy and world.\n\nThe basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion con\u00adsists of the con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions in which there is a healthy hu\u00adman (with a healthy liver) hav\u00ading the goal of mak\u00ading money\n\nThe tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions are those in which this per\u00adson\u2019s bank bal\u00adance is high. (In\u00adter\u00adest\u00adingly there is no up\u00adper bound here, so there is no fixed point but rather a con\u00adtin\u00adu\u00adous gra\u00addi\u00adent.)\n\nWe can ex\u00adpect that this per\u00adson is ca\u00adpa\u00adble of over\u00adcom\u00ading a rea\u00adson\u00adably broad va\u00adri\u00adety of ob\u00adsta\u00adcles in pur\u00adsuit of mak\u00ading money, so we rec\u00adog\u00adnize that this over\u00adall sys\u00adtem (the hu\u00adman to\u00adgether with the whole econ\u00adomy) is an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem. But Filan would surely agree on this point and his ques\u00adtion is more spe\u00adcific: he is ask\u00ading whether the liver is an op\u00adti\u00admizer.\nIn gen\u00aderal we can\u00adnot ex\u00adpect to de\u00adcom\u00adpose op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems into an en\u00adg\u00adine of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion and ob\u00adject of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion. We can see that the sys\u00adtem has the char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adis\u00adtics of an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem, and we may iden\u00adtify parts, in\u00adclud\u00ading in this case the per\u00adson\u2019s liver, that are nec\u00ades\u00adsary for these char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adis\u00adtics to ex\u00adist, but we can\u00adnot in gen\u00aderal iden\u00adtify any crisp sub\u00adset of the sys\u00adtem as that which is do\u00ading the op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion.

Or sup\u00adpose we looked at a car and no\u00adticed that the fuel pump is a com\u00adplex piece of ma\u00adchin\u00adery with\u00adout which the car\u2019s lo\u00adco\u00admo\u00adtion would cease. We might ask: is this fuel pump the true \u201cen\u00adg\u00adine of lo\u00adco\u00admo\u00adtion\u201d? Th\u00adese ques\u00adtions don\u2019t have an\u00adswers be\u00adcause they mis\u00adtak\u00adenly pre\u00adsup\u00adpose that we can iden\u00adtify a sub\u00adsys\u00adtem that is uniquely re\u00adspon\u00adsi\u00adble for the or\u00adbit\u00ading of the planet or the lo\u00adco\u00admo\u00adtion of the car. Ask\u00ading whether a hu\u00adman liver is an \u201cop\u00adti\u00admizer\u201d is similarly mis\u00adtaken: we can see that the liver is a com\u00adplex piece of ma\u00adchin\u00adery that is nec\u00ades\u00adsary in or\u00adder for the over\u00adall sys\u00adtem to ex\u00adhibit the char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adis\u00adtics of an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem (ro\u00adbust evolu\u00adtion to\u00adwards a tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set), but be\u00adyond this it makes no more sense to ask whether the liver is a true \u201clo\u00adcus of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion\u201d.\nSo rather than an\u00adswer\u00ading Filan\u2019s ques\u00adtion in ei\u00adther the pos\u00adi\u00adtive or the nega\u00adtive, the ap\u00adpro\u00adpri\u00adate move is to dis\u00adsolve the con\u00adcept of an op\u00adti\u00admizer, and in\u00adstead ask whether the over\u00adall sys\u00adtem is an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem.\nEx\u00adam\u00adple: the uni\u00adverse as a whole\nCon\u00adsider the whole phys\u00adi\u00adcal uni\u00adverse as a sin\u00adgle closed sys\u00adtem.

Out of all pos\u00adsi\u00adble con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions of the uni\u00adverse, the vast ma\u00adjor\u00adity of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions are at or close to max\u00adi\u00admum en\u00adtropy. That is, if we sam\u00adple a con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion of the uni\u00adverse at ran\u00addom, we have only an as\u00adtro\u00adnom\u00adi\u00adcally tiny chance of find\u00ading any\u00adthing other than a close-to-uniform gas of ba\u00adsic par\u00adti\u00adcles.

(Or per\u00adhaps it would be more ac\u00adcu\u00adrate to say that it qual\u00adifies as an ex\u00adtremely weak op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem.)\nPower sources and entropy\nThe sec\u00adond law of ther\u00admo\u00addy\u00adnam\u00adics tells us that any closed sys\u00adtem will even\u00adtu\u00adally tend to\u00adwards a max\u00adi\u00admally di\u00ads\u00ador\u00addered state in which mat\u00adter and en\u00adergy is spread ap\u00adprox\u00adi\u00admately uniformly through space. So if we were to iso\u00adlate one of the sys\u00adtems ex\u00adplore above in\u00adside a sealed cham\u00adber and leave it for a very long pe\u00adriod then even\u00adtu\u00adally what\u00adever power source we put in\u00adside the sealed cham\u00adber would be\u00adcome de\u00adpleted, and then even\u00adtu\u00adally af\u00adter that ev\u00adery com\u00adplex ma\u00adte\u00adrial or com\u00adpound in the sys\u00adtem would de\u00adgrade into its base prod\u00aducts, and then fi\u00adnally we would be left with a cham\u00adber filled with a uniform gaseous mix\u00adture of what\u00adever base el\u00ade\u00adments we origi\u00adnally put in.\nSo in this sense there are no op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems at all, since any of the sys\u00adtems above evolve to\u00adwards their tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion sets only for a finite pe\u00adriod of time, af\u00adter which they de\u00adgrade and evolve to\u00adwards a max\u00aden\u00adtropy con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion.\nThis is not a very se\u00adri\u00adous challenge to our defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion since it is com\u00admon through\u00adout physics and com\u00adputer sci\u00adence to study var\u00adi\u00adous \u201csteady-state\u201d or \u201cfixed point\u201d sys\u00adtems even though the same ob\u00adjec\u00adtion could be made about any of them.

This is po\u00adten\u00adtially valuable since \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion\u201d is a word of\u00adten used in dis\u00adcus\u00adsions about AI risk, and much con\u00adfu\u00adsion can fol\u00adlow from sloppy use of the term or from differ\u00adent peo\u00adple un\u00adder\u00adstand\u00ading it differ\u00adently. While the defi\u00adni\u00adtion given here is a use\u00adful per\u00adspec\u00adtive, I have some reser\u00adva\u00adtions about the claims made about its rele\u00advance and ap\u00adpli\u00adca\u00adtions.\nThe key para\u00adgraph, which sum\u00adma\u00adrizes the defi\u00adni\u00adtion it\u00adself, is the fol\u00adlow\u00ading:\n\nAn op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem is a sys\u00adtem that has a ten\u00addency to evolve to\u00adwards one of a set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions that we will call the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set, when started from any con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion within a larger set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions, which we call the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion, and con\u00adtinues to ex\u00adhibit this ten\u00addency with re\u00adspect to the same tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set de\u00adspite per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions.\n\nIn fact, \u201ccon\u00adtinues to ex\u00adhibit this ten\u00addency with re\u00adspect to the same tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set de\u00adspite per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions\u201d is re\u00addun\u00addant: clearly as long as the per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion doesn\u2019t push the sys\u00adtem out of the basin, the ten\u00addency must con\u00adtinue.\nThis is what is known as \u201cat\u00adtrac\u00adtor\u201d in dy\u00adnam\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtems the\u00adory. For com\u00adpar\u00adi\u00adson, here is the defi\u00adni\u00adtion of \u201cat\u00adtrac\u00adtor\u201d from the Wikipe\u00addia:\n\nIn the math\u00ade\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcal field of dy\u00adnam\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtems, an at\u00adtrac\u00adtor is a set of states to\u00adward which a sys\u00adtem tends to evolve, for a wide va\u00adri\u00adety of start\u00ading con\u00addi\u00adtions of the sys\u00adtem. Sys\u00adtem val\u00adues that get close enough to the at\u00adtrac\u00adtor val\u00adues re\u00admain close even if slightly dis\u00adturbed.\n\nThe au\u00adthor ac\u00adknowl\u00adedges this con\u00adnec\u00adtion, al\u00adthough he also makes the fol\u00adlow\u00ading re\u00admark:\n\nWe have dis\u00adcussed sys\u00adtems that evolve to\u00adwards tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions along some di\u00admen\u00adsions but not oth\u00aders (e.g. ball in a valley). We have not yet dis\u00adcov\u00adered whether dy\u00adnam\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtems the\u00adory ex\u00adplic\u00aditly stud\u00adies at\u00adtrac\u00adtors that op\u00ader\u00adate along a sub\u00adset of the sys\u00adtem\u2019s di\u00admen\u00adsions.\n\nI find this re\u00admark con\u00adfus\u00ading. An at\u00adtrac\u00adtor that op\u00ader\u00adates along a sub\u00adset of the di\u00admen\u00adsion is just an at\u00adtrac\u00adtor sub\u00adman\u00adi\u00adfold. This is com\u00adpletely stan\u00addard in dy\u00adnam\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtems the\u00adory.\nGiven that the defi\u00adni\u00adtion it\u00adself is not es\u00adpe\u00adcially novel, the post\u2019s main claim to value is via the ap\u00adpli\u00adca\u00adtions. Un\u00adfor\u00adtu\u00adnately, some of the pro\u00adposed ap\u00adpli\u00adca\u00adtions seem to me poorly jus\u00adtified. Speci\u00adfi\u00adcally, I want to talk about two ma\u00adjor ex\u00adam\u00adples: the claimed re\u00adla\u00adtion\u00adship to em\u00adbed\u00added agency and the claimed re\u00adla\u00adtions to com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsive AI ser\u00advices.\nIn both cases, the main short\u00adcom\u00ading of the defi\u00adni\u00adtion is that there is an es\u00adsen\u00adtial prop\u00aderty of AI that this defi\u00adni\u00adtion doesn\u2019t cap\u00adture at all. The au\u00adthor does ac\u00adknowl\u00adedge that \u201cgoal-di\u00adrected agent sys\u00adtem\u201d is a dis\u00adtinct con\u00adcept from \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems\u201d. How\u00adever, he doesn\u2019t ex\u00adplain how are they dis\u00adtinct.\nOne way to for\u00admu\u00adlate the differ\u00adence is as fol\u00adlows: agency = op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion + learn\u00ading. An agent is not just ca\u00adpa\u00adble of steer\u00ading a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar uni\u00adverse to\u00adwards a cer\u00adtain out\u00adcome, it is ca\u00adpa\u00adble of steer\u00ading an en\u00adtire class of uni\u00adverses, with\u00adout know\u00ading in ad\u00advance in which uni\u00adverse it was placed. This un\u00adder\u00adlies all of RL the\u00adory, this is im\u00adplicit in the Shane-Legg defi\u00adni\u00adtion of in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence and my own[1], this is what Yud\u00adkowsky calls \u201ccross do\u00admain\u201d.\nThe is\u00adsue of learn\u00ading is not just nit\u00adpick\u00ading, it is cru\u00adcial to delineate the bound\u00adary around \u201cAI risk\u201d, and delineat\u00ading the bound\u00adary is cru\u00adcial to con\u00adstruc\u00adtively think of solu\u00adtions. If we ig\u00adnore learn\u00ading and just talk about \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion risks\u201d then we will have to in\u00adclude the risk of pan\u00addemics (be\u00adcause bac\u00adte\u00adria are op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for in\u00adfec\u00adtion), the risk of false vac\u00aduum col\u00adlapse in par\u00adti\u00adcle ac\u00adcel\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtors (be\u00adcause vac\u00aduum bub\u00adbles are op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for ex\u00adpand\u00ading), the risk of run\u00adaway global warm\u00ading (be\u00adcause it is op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for in\u00adcreas\u00ading tem\u00adper\u00ada\u00adture) et cetera. But, these are very differ\u00adent risks that re\u00adquire very differ\u00adent solu\u00adtions.\nThere is an\u00adother, less cen\u00adtral, differ\u00adence: the au\u00adthor re\u00adquires a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar set of \u201ctar\u00adget states\u201d whereas in the con\u00adtext of agency it is more nat\u00adu\u00adral to con\u00adsider util\u00adity func\u00adtions, which means there is a con\u00adtin\u00adu\u00adous gra\u00adda\u00adtion of states rather than just \u201cgood states\u201d and \u201cbad states\u201d. This is re\u00adlated to the differ\u00adence the au\u00adthor points out be\u00adtween his defi\u00adni\u00adtion and Yud\u00adkowsky\u2019s:\n\nWhen dis\u00adcern\u00ading the bound\u00adary be\u00adtween op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion and non-op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion, we look prin\u00adci\u00adpally at ro\u00adbust\u00adness \u2014 whether the sys\u00adtem will con\u00adtinue to evolve to\u00adwards its tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set in the face of per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions \u2014 whereas Yud\u00adkowsky looks at the im\u00adprob\u00ada\u00adbil\u00adity of the fi\u00adnal con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion.\n\nThe im\u00adprob\u00ada\u00adbil\u00adity of the fi\u00adnal con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion is a con\u00adtin\u00adu\u00adous met\u00adric, whereas just ar\u00adriv\u00ading or not ar\u00adriv\u00ading at a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar set is dis\u00adcrete.\nLet\u2019s see how this short\u00adcom\u00ading af\u00adfects the con\u00adclu\u00adsions. About em\u00adbed\u00added agency, the au\u00adthor writes:\n\nOne could view the Embed\u00added Agency work as enu\u00admer\u00adat\u00ading the many log\u00adi\u00adcal pit\u00adfalls one falls into if one takes the \u201cop\u00adti\u00admizer\u201d con\u00adcept as the start\u00ading point for de\u00adsign\u00ading in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgent sys\u00adtems, rather than \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem\u201d as we pro\u00adpose here.\n\nThe cor\u00adrect start\u00ading point is \u201cagent\u201d, defined in the way I ges\u00adtured at above. If in\u00adstead we start with \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem\u201d then we throw away the baby with the bath\u00adwa\u00adter, since the cru\u00adcial as\u00adpect of learn\u00ading is ig\u00adnored. This is an es\u00adsen\u00adtial prop\u00aderty of the em\u00adbed\u00added agency prob\u00adlem: ar\u00adguably the en\u00adtire difficulty is about how can we define learn\u00ading with\u00adout in\u00adtro\u00adduc\u00ading un\u00adphys\u00adi\u00adcal du\u00adal\u00adism (in\u00addeed, I have re\u00adcently ad\u00addressed this prob\u00adlem, and \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem\u201d doesn\u2019t seem very helpful there).\nAbout com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsive AI ser\u00advices:\n\nOur per\u00adspec\u00adtive is that there is a spe\u00adcific class of in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgent sys\u00adtems \u2014 which we call op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems \u2014 that are wor\u00adthy of spe\u00adcial at\u00adten\u00adtion and study due to their po\u00adten\u00adtial to re\u00adshape the world. The set of op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems is smaller than the set of all AI ser\u00advices, but larger than the set of goal-di\u00adrected agen\u00adtic sys\u00adtems.\n\nWhat is an ex\u00adam\u00adple of an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AI sys\u00adtem that is not agen\u00adtic? The au\u00adthor doesn\u2019t give such an ex\u00adam\u00adple and in\u00adstead talks about trees, which are not AIs. I agree that the class of dan\u00adger\u00adous sys\u00adtems is sub\u00adstan\u00adtially wider than the class of sys\u00adtems which were ex\u00adplic\u00aditly de\u00adsigned with agency in mind. How\u00adever, this is pre\u00adcisely be\u00adcause agency can arise from such sys\u00adtems even when not ex\u00adplic\u00aditly de\u00adsigned, and more\u00adover this is hard to avoid if the sys\u00adtem is to be pow\u00ader\u00adful enough for pivotal acts. This is not be\u00adcause there is some class of \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AI sys\u00adtems\u201d which are in\u00adter\u00adme\u00addi\u00adate be\u00adtween \u201cagen\u00adtic\u201d and \u201cnon-agen\u00adtic\u201d.\nTo sum\u00adma\u00adrize, I agree with and en\u00adcourage the use of tools from dy\u00adnam\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtems the\u00adory to study AI. How\u00adever, one must ac\u00adknowl\u00adedge to cor\u00adrect scope of these tools and what they don\u2019t do. More\u00adover, more work is needed be\u00adfore truly novel con\u00adclu\u00adsions can be ob\u00adtained by these means.\n\n\n\u21a9\ufe0eMo\u00addulo is\u00adsues with traps which I will not go into atm. \n\nWhat links here?Vaniver's comment on 2020 Re\u00adview: The Dis\u00adcus\u00adsion Phase by Vaniver (23 Dec 2021 3:11 UTC; 5 points)Rohin Shah 21 Jun 2020 20:03 UTC LW: 59 AF: 28AFThis is ex\u00adcel\u00adlent, it feels way bet\u00adter as a defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion than past at\u00adtempts :) Thanks in par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar for the aca\u00addemic style, speci\u00adfi\u00adcally re\u00adlat\u00ading it to pre\u00advi\u00adous work, it made it much more ac\u00adcessible for me.Let\u2019s try to build up some core AI al\u00adign\u00adment ar\u00adgu\u00adments with this defi\u00adni\u00adtion.Task: A task is sim\u00adply an \u201cen\u00advi\u00adron\u00adment\u201d along with a tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set. When\u00adever I talk about a \u201ctask\u201d be\u00adlow, as\u00adsume that I mean an \u201cin\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading\u201d task, i.e. some\u00adthing like \u201cbuild a chair\u201d, as op\u00adposed to \u201chave the air molecules be in one of these par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions\u201d.Solv\u00ading a task: An ob\u00adject O solves a task T if adding O to T\u2019s en\u00advi\u00adron\u00adment trans\u00adforms it into an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem for the T\u2019s tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set.Perfor\u00admance on the task: If O solves task T, its perfor\u00admance is quan\u00adtified by how quickly it reaches the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set, and how ro\u00adbust it is to per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions.Gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adity of in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence: The gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adity of O\u2019s in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence is a func\u00adtion of the num\u00adber and di\u00adver\u00adsity of tasks T that it can solve, as well as its perfor\u00admance on those tasks.Op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AI: A com\u00adputer pro\u00adgram for which there ex\u00adists an in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading task such that the com\u00adputer pro\u00adgram solves that task.This isn\u2019t ex\u00adactly right, as it in\u00adcludes e.g. ac\u00adcount\u00ading pro\u00adgrams or video games, which when paired with a hu\u00adman form an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem for cor\u00adrect fi\u00adnan\u00adcials and win\u00adning the game, re\u00adspec\u00adtively. You might be able to fix this by say\u00ading that the op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem has to be ro\u00adbust to per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions in any hu\u00adman be\u00adhav\u00adior in the en\u00advi\u00adron\u00adment.AGI: An op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AI whose gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adity of in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence is at least as great as that of hu\u00admans.Ar\u00adgu\u00adment for AI risk: As op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AIs be\u00adcome more and more gen\u00aderal, we will ap\u00adply them to more eco\u00adnom\u00adi\u00adcally use\u00adful tasks T. How\u00adever, they also be\u00adcome more and more ro\u00adbust to per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions, pos\u00adsi\u00adbly in\u00adclud\u00ading per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions such as \u201cwe try to turn off the AI\u201d. As a re\u00adsult, we might even\u00adtu\u00adally have AIs that form strong op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems for some task T that isn\u2019t the one we ac\u00adtu\u00adally wanted, which tends to be bad due to frag\u00adility of value.Deep learn\u00ading AGI im\u00adplies mesa op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion: Since deep learn\u00ading is so sam\u00adple in\u00adeffi\u00adcient, it can\u00adnot reach hu\u00adman lev\u00adels of perfor\u00admance if we ap\u00adply deep learn\u00ading di\u00adrectly to each pos\u00adsi\u00adble task T. (For ex\u00adam\u00adple, it has to re\u00adlearn how the world works sep\u00ada\u00adrately for each task T.) As a re\u00adsult, if we do get AGI pri\u00admar\u00adily via deep learn\u00ading, it must be that we used deep learn\u00ading to cre\u00adate a new op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AI sys\u00adtem, and that sys\u00adtem was the AGI.Ar\u00adgu\u00adment for mesa op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion: Due to the com\u00adplex\u00adity and noise in the real world, most eco\u00adnom\u00adi\u00adcally use\u00adful tasks re\u00adquire set\u00adting up a ro\u00adbust op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem, rather than di\u00adrectly cre\u00adat\u00ading the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion state. (See also the im\u00adpor\u00adtance of feed\u00adback for more on this in\u00adtu\u00adition.) It seems likely that hu\u00admans will find it eas\u00adier to cre\u00adate al\u00adgorithms that then find AGIs that can cre\u00adate these ro\u00adbust op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems, rather than cre\u00adat\u00ading an al\u00adgorithm that is di\u00adrectly an AGI.(The pre\u00advi\u00adous ar\u00adgu\u00adment also ap\u00adplies: this is ba\u00adsi\u00adcally just a gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adiza\u00adtion of the pre\u00advi\u00adous point to ar\u00adbi\u00adtrary AI sys\u00adtems, in\u00adstead of only deep learn\u00ading.)I want to note that un\u00adder this ap\u00adproach the no\u00adtion of \u201csearch\u201d and \u201cmesa ob\u00adjec\u00adtive\u201d are less nat\u00adu\u00adral, which I see as a pro of this ap\u00adproach (see also here): the ar\u00adgu\u00adment is that we\u2019ll get a gen\u00aderal in\u00adner op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AI, but it doesn\u2019t say much about what task that AI will be op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for (and it could be an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AI that is re\u00adtar\u00adgetable by hu\u00adman in\u00adstruc\u00adtions).Outer al\u00adign\u00adment: ???

As men\u00adtioned above, it\u2019s hard to for\u00admal\u00adize in this frame\u00adwork, as in\u00adtent al\u00adign\u00adment re\u00adally does re\u00adquire some no\u00adtion of \u201cmo\u00adti\u00adva\u00adtion\u201d, \u201cgoals\u201d, or \u201ctry\u00ading\u201d, which this frame\u00adwork ex\u00adplic\u00aditly leaves out. I see this as a con of this frame\u00adwork.Ex\u00adpected util\u00adity max\u00adi\u00admiza\u00adtion: One par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar ar\u00adchi\u00adtec\u00adture that could qual\u00adify as an AGI (if the util\u00adity func\u00adtion is treated as part of the en\u00advi\u00adron\u00adment, and not part of the AGI). I see the fact that EU max\u00adi\u00admiza\u00adtion is no longer high\u00adlighted as a pro of this ap\u00adproach.Wire\u00adhead\u00ading: Spe\u00adcial case of the ar\u00adgu\u00adment for AI risk with a weird task of \u201cmax\u00adi\u00admize the num\u00adber in this reg\u00adister\u201d.

(For ex\u00adam\u00adple, it has to re\u00adlearn how the world works sep\u00ada\u00adrately for each task T.) As a re\u00adsult, if we do get AGI pri\u00admar\u00adily via deep learn\u00ading, it must be that we used deep learn\u00ading to cre\u00adate a new op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AI sys\u00adtem, and that sys\u00adtem was the AGI.I don\u2019t quite un\u00adder\u00adstand what this is say\u00ading.Sup\u00adpose we train a gi\u00adant deep learn\u00ading model via self-su\u00adper\u00advised learn\u00ading on a ton of real-world data (like GPT-N, but w\/\u200b other sen\u00adsory modal\u00adities be\u00adsides text), and then we build a sec\u00adond sys\u00adtem de\u00adsigned to provide a nice in\u00adter\u00adface to the gi\u00adant model.We\u2019d give task speci\u00adfi\u00adca\u00adtions to the in\u00adter\u00adface, and it would have some smarts about how to con\u00adsult the model to figure out what to do. (The in\u00adter\u00adface might also be learned, via re\u00adin\u00adforce\u00adment or su\u00adper\u00advised learn\u00ading, or it might be hand-coded.)It seems plau\u00adsi\u00adble to me that a sys\u00adtem com\u00adpris\u00ading these two pieces, the model and the in\u00adter\u00adface, could be an AGI ac\u00adcord\u00ading to the defi\u00adni\u00adtion here, in that when com\u00adbined with a very wide va\u00adri\u00adety of en\u00advi\u00adron\u00adments (in\u00adclud\u00ading the task speci\u00adfi\u00adca\u00adtion in the en\u00advi\u00adron\u00adment), it could perform at least as well as a hu\u00adman.And since most of the smarts seem like they\u2019d be in the model rather than the in\u00adter\u00adface, I\u2019d count it as get\u00adting AGI \u201cpri\u00admar\u00adily via deep learn\u00ading\u201d, even if the in\u00adter\u00adface was hand-coded.But it\u2019s not clear to me whether that would count as us\u00ading deep learn\u00ading to \u201ccre\u00adate a new op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading AI sys\u00adtem\u201d, which is it\u00adself the AGI.

Here are her com\u00adments, which she asked me to share:This es\u00adsay pro\u00adposes a very in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion as the man\u00adi\u00adfes\u00adta\u00adtion of a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar be\u00adhav\u00adior of a closed, phys\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtem. I haven\u2019t finished think\u00ading this over, but I sus\u00adpect it will be (as is sug\u00adgested in the es\u00adsay) a use\u00adful con\u00adstruct. The rea\u00adson\u00ading lead\u00ading to the defi\u00adni\u00adtion is clearly laid out (thank you!), with ex\u00adam\u00adples that are very use\u00adful in un\u00adder\u00adstand\u00ading the con\u00adcept. The down\u00adside of be\u00ading clearly laid out, how\u00adever, is that it makes cri\u00adtique eas\u00adier. I have a few thoughts about the rea\u00adson\u00ading in the es\u00adsay.The first thing I will note is that the es\u00adsay gives three defi\u00adni\u00adtions for an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem. Th\u00adese defi\u00adni\u00adtions are close, but not ex\u00adactly equiv\u00ada\u00adlent. The nu\u00adances can be im\u00adpor\u00adtant. For ex\u00adam\u00adple, that the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set and the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion can\u00adnot be equal is ob\u00advi\u00adous; that is made ex\u00adplicit in defi\u00adni\u00adtion 3, but only im\u00adplied in defi\u00adni\u00adtions 1 and 2. A big\u00adger is\u00adsue is that there are no crite\u00adria or ra\u00adtio\u00adnale for their ex\u00adtent and rel\u00ada\u00adtive size. For ex\u00adam\u00adple, the es\u00adsay offers two rea\u00adsons why the poster\u00adchild of non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00aders\u2014the bot\u00adtle with a cap\u2014is not an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem; they both arise from the rather ar\u00adbi\u00adtrary defi\u00adni\u00adtion of the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion as equal to the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set. I see no nec\u00ades\u00adsary rea\u00adson why the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion couldn\u2019t be defined as the set of all con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions of wa\u00adter molecules both in\u00adside and out\u00adside the bot\u00adtle. That way, the defi\u00adni\u00adtional re\u00adquire\u00adment of a tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set smaller than the ba\u00adsis of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion is met. The im\u00adpor\u00adtant point is: will wa\u00adter molecules in this new, larger basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion tend to the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set? Let\u2019s sup\u00adpose that capped bot\u00adtle is in a sealed room (not nec\u00ades\u00adsary but eas\u00adier to think about), and that the cap is made of a spe\u00adcial ma\u00adte\u00adrial that al\u00adlows wa\u00adter molecules to pass through it in only one di\u00adrec\u00adtion: from out\u00adside the bot\u00adtle to in\u00adside. The wa\u00adter molecules in\u00adside the bot\u00adtle stay in\u00adside the bot\u00adtle, as for any cap. The wa\u00adter molecules in\u00adside the room, but out\u00adside the bot\u00adtle, are zoom\u00ading about (ther\u00admo\u00addy\u00adnamic en\u00adergy), bounc\u00ading off the walls, each other, and the bot\u00adtle. Although it will take some time, sooner or later all the molecules out\u00adside the bot\u00adtle will hit the bot\u00adtle cap, go through, and be trapped in the bot\u00adtle. Voila! Origi\u00adnally, the bot\u00adtle-with-a-cap sys\u00adtem was a non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem by defi\u00adni\u00adtion; the bot\u00adtle cap type was ir\u00adrele\u00advant and could have been the rather spe\u00adcial one I de\u00adscribed. Sim\u00adply by chang\u00ading the defi\u00adni\u00adtion of the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion, we could turn it into an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem. Fur\u00adther, the origi\u00adnal, \u201cnon-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading\u201d sys\u00adtem (with the origi\u00adnal defi\u00adni\u00adtions of the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion and tar\u00adget set) would have be\u00adhaved ex\u00adactly the same as my op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem. On the other hand, chang\u00ading the bot\u00adtle cap from our spe\u00adcial one to a reg\u00adu\u00adlar cap will change the sys\u00adtem into a non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem, re\u00adgard\u00adless of the defi\u00adni\u00adtions of the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion and the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set. Per\u00adhaps, we should in\u00adsist that a prop\u00aderly formed sys\u00adtem de\u00adscrip\u00adtion has a basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion that is larger than the tar\u00adget set, and count on the sys\u00adtem be\u00adhav\u00adior to make the op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading\/\u200bnon-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading dis\u00adtinc\u00adtion.Defi\u00adni\u00adtions 1 and 2 both con\u00adtain the phrase \u201ca small set of tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions\u201d which im\u00adplies that the tar\u00adget set << than the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion. This is a prob\u00adlem for the no\u00adtion of the uni\u00adverse as a sys\u00adtem with max\u00adi\u00admum en\u00adtropy as the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set be\u00adcause the tar\u00adget set is most of the pos\u00adsi\u00adble con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions. For this rea\u00adson, the es\u00adsay\u2019s au\u00adthor con\u00adcludes that uni\u00adverse-with-en\u00adtropy sys\u00adtem is not an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem, or at best, a weak one. Stars, galax\u00adies, black holes \u2013 there are strong forces that pull mat\u00adter into these struc\u00adtures. I would say that any sys\u00adtem that has suc\u00adceeded in get\u00adting nearly ev\u00adery\u00adthing within the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion into the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion is a strong op\u00adti\u00admizer! Re\u00adgard\u00adless of the way we chose to think about strong or weak, the uni\u00adverse is a sys\u00adtem that tends to a set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions smaller than the set of pos\u00adsi\u00adble con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions de\u00adspite per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions (the oc\u00adca\u00adsional house-build\u00ading pro\u00adject for ex\u00adam\u00adple!). Per\u00adson\u00adally, I see no value in a defi\u00adni\u00adtional limi\u00adta\u00adtion. The be\u00adhav\u00adior of the sys\u00adtem (tend\u00ading to\u00adward a smaller set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions out of a larger set) should gov\u00adern the defi\u00adni\u00adtion of an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem, re\u00adgard\u00adless of rel\u00ada\u00adtive sizes of the sets.Between the uni\u00adverse-with-en\u00adtropy and bot\u00adtle-with-a-cap sys\u00adtems, I ques\u00adtion the util\u00adity of the \u201call con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions >= basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion >> tar\u00adget set con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion\u201d struc\u00adture in the defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems. I be\u00adlieve it is worth think\u00ading about what the nec\u00ades\u00adsary re\u00adla\u00adtion\u00adships among these con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions are, and how they are cho\u00adsen.The ex\u00adam\u00adple of the billiards sys\u00adtem raised an\u00adother (to me) in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading ques\u00adtion. The es\u00adsay did not offer a sys\u00adtem de\u00adscrip\u00adtion but says \u201cCon\u00adsider a billiard table with some billiard balls that are cur\u00adrently bounc\u00ading around in mo\u00adtion. Left alone, the balls will even\u00adtu\u00adally come to rest in some con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion\u2026. If we reach in while the billiard balls are bounc\u00ading around and move one of the balls that is in mo\u00adtion, the sys\u00adtem will now come to rest in a differ\u00adent con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion. There\u00adfore this is not an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem, be\u00adcause there is no set of tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions to\u00adwards which the sys\u00adtem evolves de\u00adspite per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions.\u201d This ex\u00adam\u00adple has some odd fea\u00adtures. Fric\u00adtion be\u00adtween the balls and the table sur\u00adface, along with the loss of en\u00adergy dur\u00ading non-elas\u00adtic col\u00adli\u00adsions, cause the balls to slow down and stop. The minu\u00adtia of their trav\u00adels de\u00adter\u00admines where they stop. The fi\u00adnal ar\u00adrange\u00adment is un\u00adpre\u00addictable (ok, it could be mod\u00adeled given com\u00adplete in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion, but let\u2019s skip that as beside the point), and any ar\u00adrange\u00adment is as likely as an\u00adother. This sug\u00adgests that the billiards sys\u00adtem is a non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem even with\u00adout the pro\u00adposed per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion of mov\u00ading the balls around while the balls are in mo\u00adtion. Looked at an\u00adother way, billiards sys\u00adtem does tend to a cer\u00adtain tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set, while fric\u00adtion and the non-elas\u00adtic\u00adity of the col\u00adli\u00adsions are per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions. If we make the sur\u00adface fric\u00adtion\u00adless and the col\u00adli\u00adsions perfectly elas\u00adtic, the balls will bounce around the table with\u00adout stop\u00adping. Much like the wa\u00adter molecules in the bot\u00adtle-with-a-cap ex\u00adam\u00adple, each will even\u00adtu\u00adally fall into one pocket or an\u00adother dur\u00ading its trav\u00adels. Once in the pocket, the ball can\u00adnot get out, and thus even\u00adtu\u00adally all will end up in the pock\u00adets. So, this sys\u00adtem tends to a tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set of all balls in pock\u00adets. Ad\u00adding back in the per\u00adturb\u00ading fric\u00adtion and en\u00adergy loss does not mean that this sys\u00adtem is not tend\u00ading to the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set. Reach\u00ading in and mov\u00ading a ball to a differ\u00adent point, or even redi\u00adrect\u00ading any ball head\u00ading for a pocket, will not keep this sys\u00adtem from tend\u00ading to\u00adwards the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion. It seems as though the billiards sys\u00adtem was an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem all along! The larger point is that it seems, by defi\u00adni\u00adtion, an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem is an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem even if there are a set of per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions that pre\u00advent it from ever reach\u00ading the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion! \u201cTend\u00ading to\u00adward\u201d, not \u201creach\u00ading\u201d, a tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set is in all three defi\u00adni\u00adtions. It is worth think\u00ading about an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem that never ac\u00adtu\u00adally op\u00adti\u00admizes. This may have some bear\u00ading on the AGI ques\u00adtion.[And for you read\u00aders who, like me, would say, whoa\u2014it is pos\u00adsi\u00adble that the balls will en\u00adter some re\u00adpeat\u00ading pat\u00adtern of mo\u00adtion where some do not en\u00adter pock\u00adets. Maybe we need a robot to move the balls around ran\u00addomly if they seem stuck, just like the ball-in-valley+robot sys\u00adtem where the robot moves the ball over bar\u00adri\u00aders. I main\u00adtain that the point is the same.]The satel\u00adlite sys\u00adtem illus\u00adtrates (per\u00adhaps an ob\u00advi\u00adous point) that the defi\u00adni\u00adtion of the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set can change a sin\u00adgle sys\u00adtem from op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading and to non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading. What is a lit\u00adtle more sub\u00adtle is that the defi\u00adni\u00adtion of the sys\u00adtem bound\u00adaries is es\u00adsen\u00adtial to the char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adi\u00adza\u00adtion of the sys\u00adtem as op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading or non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading, even if the be\u00adhav\u00adior of the sys\u00adtem is the same un\u00adder both defi\u00adni\u00adtions. In par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar, what we con\u00adsider to be part of the sys\u00adtem and what is con\u00adsid\u00adered to be a per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion can flip a sys\u00adtem be\u00adtween char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adi\u00adza\u00adtions. [This lat\u00adter point is illus\u00adtrated by the billiards sys\u00adtem as well, as I will ex\u00adplain be\u00adlow.] The es\u00adsay says that a satel\u00adlite in or\u00adbit is a non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem be\u00adcause if its po\u00adsi\u00adtion or ve\u00adloc\u00adity is per\u00adturbed, it has no ten\u00addency to re\u00adturn to its origi\u00adnal or\u00adbit; that is, the au\u00adthor defines the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion as a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar or\u00adbit. With re\u00adspect to an\u00adother tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion that may be de\u00adscribed as \u201ca scorched pile of junk on the sur\u00adface of the Earth\u201d, a satel\u00adlite in or\u00adbit is an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem ex\u00adactly like a ball in a valley. As soon as the launch rocket stops firing, a satel\u00adlite starts fal\u00adling to the cen\u00adter of the earth be\u00adcause at\u00admo\u00adspheric drag and so\u00adlar ra\u00addi\u00ada\u00adtion pres\u00adsure con\u00adtin\u00adu\u00adously de\u00adcrease the com\u00adpo\u00adnent of the satel\u00adlite\u2019s ve\u00adloc\u00adity per\u00adpen\u00addicu\u00adlar to the force of grav\u00adity. So, un\u00adless a per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion is big enough to send it out of or\u00adbit al\u00adto\u00adgether, a satel\u00adlite tends to\u00adwards a tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion of junk lo\u00adcated on Earth\u2019s sur\u00adface.Since a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar or\u00adbit is usu\u00adally the de\u00adsired tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion (!), many satel\u00adlites in\u00adcor\u00adpo\u00adrate a rocket sys\u00adtem to force them to stay in a cho\u00adsen or\u00adbit. If a rocket sys\u00adtem is in\u00adcluded in the sys\u00adtem defi\u00adni\u00adtion, then the satel\u00adlite is an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem rel\u00ada\u00adtive to the de\u00adsired or\u00adbit. What is a lit\u00adtle more in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading, with re\u00adspect to the junk-on-the-Earth tar\u00adget set, drag and so\u00adlar pres\u00adsure are the part of the op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem; an or\u00adbit cor\u00adrec\u00adtion sys\u00adtem is a per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion. If the tar\u00adget set is the par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar or\u00adbit the satel\u00adlite started in, these defi\u00adni\u00adtions swap. This ob\u00adser\u00adva\u00adtion has bear\u00ading on the billiards sys\u00adtem ex\u00adam\u00adple. If we in\u00adclude drag and non-elas\u00adtic col\u00adli\u00adsions as part of the billiards sys\u00adtem, then the sys\u00adtem is non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading. If we see them as per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions out\u00adside the sys\u00adtem, then the billiards sys\u00adtem is op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading. I find this flex\u00adi\u00adbil\u00adity as a lit\u00adtle cu\u00adri\u00adous, al\u00adthough I haven\u2019t com\u00adpletely thought through the im\u00adpli\u00adca\u00adtions.A com\u00adpletely differ\u00adent sort of ques\u00adtion is sug\u00adgested by the sec\u00adtion on Drexler. There the es\u00adsay sets out a hi\u00ader\u00adar\u00adchy of all AI sys\u00adtems, op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems, and goal-di\u00adrected agent sys\u00adtems. This makes sense with re\u00adspect to AI sys\u00adtems, but I do not see how op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems, as defined, can be wholly con\u00adtained within the cat\u00ade\u00adgory of AI sys\u00adtems, un\u00adless you define AI sys\u00adtems pretty broadly. For ex\u00adam\u00adple, I think that pretty much any con\u00adtrol sys\u00adtem is an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem by the defi\u00adni\u00adtion in the es\u00adsay. If we ac\u00adcept this defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem, and hold that all op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems are a sub\u00adset of AI sys\u00adtems, do we have to ac\u00adcept our ther\u00admostats as AI sys\u00adtems? What about the pro\u00adgram that de\u00adter\u00admined the square root of 2? Is that AI? Is this an is\u00adsue for this defi\u00adni\u00adtion, or does its broad\u00adness mat\u00adter in an AI con\u00adtext?And a nit\u00adpick: The first ex\u00adam\u00adple of an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem offered in the es\u00adsay is a pro\u00adgram calcu\u00adlat\u00ading the square root of 2. It meets the defi\u00adni\u00adtion of an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem, but it seems to con\u00adtra\u00addict the ear\u00adlier as\u00adser\u00adtion that \u201c\u2026 op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems are not some\u00adthing that are de\u00adsigned but are dis\u00adcov\u00adered.\u201d The al\u00adgorithm and the pro\u00adgram were both de\u00adsigned. I\u2019m not sure why this point is nec\u00ades\u00adsary. Either I do not un\u00adder\u00adstand some\u00adthing fun\u00adda\u00admen\u00adtal, or the only pur\u00adpose of the state\u00adment of dis\u00adcov\u00adery is to give peo\u00adple like me some\u00adthing to ar\u00adgue about!In sum\u00admary, the defi\u00adni\u00adtion in the es\u00adsay sug\u00adgests a few ques\u00adtions that could have a bear\u00ading on its ap\u00adpli\u00adca\u00adtion:How do we choose the ba\u00adsis of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion rel\u00ada\u00adtive to the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set, if our choice can change the sta\u00adtus of the sys\u00adtem from op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading to non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading and vice versa?Is it an is\u00adsue that an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem may never ac\u00adtu\u00adally op\u00adti\u00admize? How do we choose what is part of the sys\u00adtem ver\u00adsus a per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion out\u00adside the sys\u00adtem when our choice changes the sta\u00adtus of the sys\u00adtem as op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading or non-op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading?All con\u00adtrol sys\u00adtems are op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems by the defi\u00adni\u00adtion, but are all con\u00adtrol sys\u00adtems AI sys\u00adtems?

Here are some fol\u00adlow-up com\u00adments to what she wrote above re\u00adlated to the evolu\u00adtion an\u00adgle:We could define the nat\u00adu\u00adral se\u00adlec\u00adtion sys\u00adtem as:All con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions = all ar\u00adrange\u00adments of mat\u00adter on a planet (both ar\u00adrange\u00adments that are liv\u00ading and those that are non-liv\u00ading) Ba\u00adsis of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion = all ar\u00adrange\u00adments of mat\u00adter on a planet that meet the defi\u00adni\u00adtion of a liv\u00ading thingTar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set = all ar\u00adrange\u00adments of liv\u00ading things where the type and num\u00adber of liv\u00ading things re\u00admains ap\u00adprox\u00adi\u00admately sta\u00adble.I think that this sys\u00adtem meets the defi\u00adni\u00adtion of an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem given in the Ground for Op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion es\u00adsay. For ex\u00adam\u00adple, preda\u00adtor and prey co-evolve to be about \u201cequal\u201d in sur\u00advival abil\u00adity. If a preda\u00adtor be\u00adcome so much bet\u00adter than its prey that it eats them all, the preda\u00adtor will die out along with its prey; the re\u00admain\u00ading an\u00adi\u00admals will be in bal\u00adance. I think this works for cli\u00admate per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions, etc. too.HOWEVER, it should be clear that there are nu\u00admer\u00adous ways in which this can hap\u00adpen \u2013 like the ball on bumpy sur\u00adface with a lot of con\u00advex \u201cvalleys\u201d (lo\u00adcal min\u00adima), there is not just one way that liv\u00ading things can be in bal\u00adance. So, to say that \u201cnat\u00adu\u00adral se\u00adlec\u00adtion op\u00adti\u00admized for in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence\u201d is quite not right \u2013 it just fell into a \u201cvalley\u201d where in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence hap\u00adpened. FURTHER, it\u2019s not clear that we have reached the lo\u00adcal min\u00adi\u00admum! Hu\u00admans may be that preda\u00adtor that is go\u00ading to fall \u201cprey\u201d to its own suc\u00adcess. If that hap\u00adpened (and any in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgent an\u00adi\u00admals re\u00admain at all), I guess we could say that nat\u00adu\u00adral se\u00adlec\u00adtion op\u00adti\u00admized for less-than-hu\u00adman in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence!Fur\u00adther, this defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion has no con\u00adno\u00adta\u00adtion of \u201cbest\u201d or even bet\u00adter \u2013 just equal to a defined set. The word \u201cop\u00adti\u00admize\u201d is loaded. And its use in con\u00adnec\u00adtion with nat\u00adu\u00adral se\u00adlec\u00adtion has led to a lot of trou\u00adble in terms of hu\u00adman races, and hu\u00admans v. an\u00adi\u00admal rights.Fi\u00adnally, in the es\u00adsay\u2019s defi\u00adni\u00adtion, there is no im\u00adper\u00ada\u00adtive that the tar\u00adget set be reached. As long as the set of liv\u00ading things is \u201ctend\u00ading\u201d to\u00adward in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence, then the sys\u00adtem is op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading.

Like a billiards sys\u00adtem where the table is slick (but not fric\u00adtion\u00adless) and the col\u00adli\u00adsions are close to elas\u00adtic, the balls may come to rest with some of the balls out\u00adside the pock\u00adets.

I\u2019d like to write a whole post about it. Here are my thoughts:\nFirst, just as a fun fact, not that it\u2019s ac\u00adtu\u00adally ex\u00adtremely rare to see any non-iter\u00ada\u00adtive op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion in prac\u00adti\u00adcal us\u00adage. When we solve lin\u00adear equa\u00adtions, we could use gaus\u00adsian elimi\u00adna\u00adtion but it\u2019s so un\u00adsta\u00adble that in prac\u00adtice we use, most likely, the SVD, which is iter\u00ada\u00adtive. When we solve a sys\u00adtem of polyno\u00admial equa\u00adtion we could use some\u00adthing like a Grob\u00adner ba\u00adsis or the re\u00adsul\u00adtant, but it\u2019s so un\u00adsta\u00adble that in prac\u00adtice we some\u00adthing like a com\u00adpan\u00adion ma\u00adtrix method, which comes down to an eigen\u00advalue de\u00adcom\u00adpo\u00adsi\u00adtion, which is again iter\u00ada\u00adtive.Con\u00adsider find\u00ading the roots of a sim\u00adple quadratic equa\u00adtion (ie solv\u00ading a cu\u00adbic op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion prob\u00adlem). We can use the quadratic equa\u00adtion to do this. But ul\u00adti\u00admately this comes down to com\u00adput\u00ading a square root, which is typ\u00adi\u00adcally (though not nec\u00ades\u00adsar\u00adily) solved with an iter\u00ada\u00adtive method.That these meth\u00adods (for solv\u00ading lin\u00adear sys\u00adtems, polyno\u00admial sys\u00adtems, and quadratic equa\u00adtions) have at their heart an iter\u00ada\u00adtive op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion al\u00adgorithm is not ac\u00adci\u00adden\u00adtal. The iter\u00ada\u00adtive meth\u00adods in\u00advolved are not some small or sideline part of what\u2019s go\u00ading on. In fact when you solve a sys\u00adtem of polyno\u00admial equa\u00adtions us\u00ading a com\u00adpan\u00adion ma\u00adtrix, you spend a lot of en\u00adergy re\u00adar\u00adrang\u00ading the sys\u00adtem into a form where it can be solved via an eigen\u00advalue de\u00adcom\u00adpo\u00adsi\u00adtion, and then the eigen\u00advalue de\u00adcom\u00adpo\u00adsi\u00adtion it\u00adself is very much op\u00ader\u00adat\u00ading on the full prob\u00adlem. It\u2019s not some unim\u00adpor\u00adtant side op\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion. I find this fas\u00adci\u00adnat\u00ading.Nev\u00ader\u00adthe\u00adless it is pos\u00adsi\u00adble to solve lin\u00adear sys\u00adtems, polyno\u00admial sys\u00adtems etc with non-iter\u00ada\u00adtive meth\u00adods.Th\u00adese meth\u00adods are definitely con\u00adsid\u00adered \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion\u201d by any nor\u00admal use of that term. So in this way my defi\u00adni\u00adtion doesn\u2019t quite line up with the com\u00admon lan\u00adguage use of the word \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion\u201d.But these non-iter\u00ada\u00adtive meth\u00adods ac\u00adtu\u00adally do not have the core prop\u00aderty that I de\u00adscribed in the square-root-of-two ex\u00adam\u00adple. If I reach in and flip a bit while a Guas\u00adsian elimi\u00adna\u00adtion is run\u00adning, the al\u00adgorithm does not in any sense re\u00adcover. Since the al\u00adgorithm is just perform\u00ading a lin\u00adear se\u00adquence of steps, the er\u00adror just grows and grows as the com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtion un\u00adfolds. This is the op\u00adpo\u00adsite of what hap\u00adpens if I reach in and flip a bit while an SVD is be\u00ading com\u00adputed: in this case the er\u00adror will be driven back to zero by the iter\u00ada\u00adtive op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion al\u00adgorithm.You might say that my fo\u00adcus on er\u00adror-cor\u00adrec\u00adtion sim\u00adply doesn\u2019t cap\u00adture the com\u00admon lan\u00adguage use of the term op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion, as demon\u00adstrated by the fact that non-iter\u00ada\u00adtive op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion al\u00adgorithms do not have this er\u00adror-cor\u00adrect\u00ading prop\u00aderty. You would be cor\u00adrect!But per\u00adhaps my real re\u00adsponse is that fun\u00adda\u00admen\u00adtally I\u2019m in\u00adter\u00adested in these pro\u00adcesses that some\u00adwhat mys\u00adte\u00adri\u00adously drive the state of the world to\u00adwards a tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion, and keep do\u00ading so de\u00adspite per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions. I think these are cen\u00adtral to what AI and agency are. The term \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem\u201d might not be quite right, but it seems close enough to be com\u00adpel\u00adling.\nThanks for the ques\u00adtion\u2014I clar\u00adified my own think\u00ading while writ\u00ading up this re\u00adsponse.\njohnswentworth 29 Jun 2020 4:50 UTC LW: 4 AF: 2AFParentAnother big thing to note in ex\u00adam\u00adples like e.g. iter\u00ada\u00adtively com\u00adput\u00ading a square root for the quadratic for\u00admula or iter\u00ada\u00adtively com\u00adput\u00ading eigen\u00adval\u00adues to solve a ma\u00adtrix: the op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion prob\u00adlems we\u2019re solv\u00ading are sub\u00adprob\u00adlems, not the origi\u00adnal full prob\u00adlem.

So it seems like ei\u00adther you need to com\u00admit to the sys\u00adtem ac\u00adtu\u00adally reach\u00ading one of the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions to call it an op\u00adti\u00admiser, or you need some sort of met\u00adric over the con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion space to tell whether it\u2019s get\u00adting closer to or fur\u00adther away from the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set.

As an ex\u00adtreme ex\u00adam\u00adple, for any given sys\u00adtem, I can always aug\u00adment the con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion space with an ar\u00adbi\u00adtrary num\u00adber of dummy di\u00admen\u00adsions, and choose the dy\u00adnam\u00adics such that these dummy di\u00admen\u00adsions always get set to all zero af\u00adter each time step. Now, I can make the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion ar\u00adbi\u00adtrar\u00adily large, while the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set re\u00admains a fixed size. This can then make any such dy\u00adnam\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtem seem to be an ar\u00adbi\u00adtrar\u00adily pow\u00ader\u00adful op\u00adti\u00admiser.This could per\u00adhaps be solved by de\u00admand\u00ading the con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion space be se\u00adlected ac\u00adcord\u00ading to Oc\u00adcam\u2019s ra\u00adzor, but I think the out\u00adcome still ends up be\u00ading prior de\u00adpen\u00addent. It\u2019d be nice for two ob\u00adservers who model op\u00adti\u00admis\u00ading sys\u00adtems in a sys\u00adtem\u00adat\u00adi\u00adcally differ\u00adent way to always agree within some con\u00adstant fac\u00adtor, akin to Kol\u00admogorov com\u00adplex\u00adity\u2019s in\u00advar\u00adi\u00adance the\u00ado\u00adrem, al\u00adthough this may well be im\u00adpos\u00adsi\u00adble.As a less face\u00adtious ex\u00adam\u00adple, con\u00adsider a com\u00adputer pro\u00adgram that re\u00adpeat\u00adedly sets a vari\u00adable to 0. It seems again we can make the op\u00adti\u00admis\u00ading power ar\u00adbi\u00adtrar\u00adily large by mak\u00ading the vari\u00adable\u2019s size ar\u00adbi\u00adtrar\u00adily large. But this doesn\u2019t quite map onto the in\u00adtu\u00aditive no\u00adtion of the \u201cdifficulty\u201d of an op\u00adti\u00admi\u00adsa\u00adtion prob\u00adlem.

But if we use an or\u00adder\u00ading over states then we run into the fol\u00adlow\u00ading prob\u00adlem: how can we say whether a sys\u00adtem is ro\u00adbust to per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions? Is it just that the sys\u00adtem con\u00adtinues to climb the prefer\u00adence gra\u00addi\u00adent de\u00adspite per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions?

You per\u00adturb the sys\u00adtem by mov\u00ading the rock out\u00adside the box. Noth\u00ading else hap\u00adpens in re\u00adsponse. How would you de\u00adscribe this as an op\u00adti\u00admis\u00ading sys\u00adtem? (I\u2019m as\u00adsum\u00ading that we\u2019re rul\u00ading out the triv\u00adial case of a con\u00adstant util\u00adity func\u00adtion; if not, we should analo\u00adgously in\u00adclude the triv\u00adial case of all states be\u00ading tar\u00adget states).As a more gen\u00aderal com\u00adment: I sus\u00adpect that what starts to hap\u00adpen af\u00adter you start dig\u00adging into what \u201cper\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion\u201d means, and what counts as a small or big per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion, is that you run into the prob\u00adlem that a *tiny* per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion can trans\u00adform a highly op\u00adti\u00admis\u00ading sys\u00adtem to a non-op\u00adti\u00admis\u00ading sys\u00adtem (e.g. flick\u00ading the switch to turn off the AGI). In or\u00adder to quan\u00adtify size of per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions in an in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading way, you need the pre-ex\u00adist\u00ading con\u00adcept of which sub\u00adsys\u00adtems are do\u00ading the op\u00adti\u00admi\u00adsa\u00adtion.My preferred solu\u00adtion to this is just to stop try\u00ading to define op\u00adti\u00admi\u00adsa\u00adtion in terms of *out\u00adcomes*, and start defin\u00ading it in terms of *com\u00adpu\u00adta\u00adtion* done by sys\u00adtems. E.g. a first at\u00adtempt might be: an agent is an op\u00adti\u00admiser if it does plan\u00adning via ab\u00adstrac\u00adtion to\u00adwards some goal. Then we can zoom in on what all these words mean, or what else we might need to in\u00adclude\/\u200bex\u00adclude (in this case, we\u2019ve ruled out evolu\u00adtion, so we prob\u00ada\u00adbly need to broaden it).

Go\u00ading by the pri\u00admary defi\u00adni\u00adtion,An op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem is a sys\u00adtem that has a ten\u00addency to evolve to\u00adwards one of a set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions that we will call the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set, when started from any con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion within a larger set of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions, which we call the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion.But in the phys\u00adi\u00adcal world, there are liter\u00adally zero closed sys\u00adtems with this prop\u00aderty. En\u00adtropy always in\u00adcreases*, and the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set will never be smaller than the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion. The dirt-plus-seed-plus-sun\u00adlight sys\u00adtem has a vastly smaller con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion space than the dirt-plus-tree-plus-heat sys\u00adtem. Per\u00adhaps one could ob\u00adject that one should dis\u00adcount the in\u00adcom\u00ading sun\u00adlight and out\u00adgo\u00ading heat since the sys\u00adtem isn\u2019t re\u00adally closed, but then con\u00adsider a very similar sys\u00adtem con\u00adsist\u00ading of only dirt, air, and fun\u00adgal spores. Surely if a grow\u00ading tree is an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem, then a grow\u00ading mush\u00adroom in a closed sys\u00adtem is an op\u00adti\u00admizer too. But the en\u00adtropy in\u00adcrease in the lat\u00adter case is un\u00adam\u00adbigu\u00adous: the num\u00adber of ways to ar\u00adrange atoms into a fully grown mush\u00adroom is again vastly larger than the num\u00adber of ways to con\u00adfigure atoms into dirt with\u00adout mush\u00adrooms but with the nu\u00adtri\u00adents to grow them.It may be pos\u00adsi\u00adble to get around this by re\u00addefin\u00ading con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion spaces that bet\u00adter match our in\u00adtu\u00adition (it does seem like a mush\u00adroom is more spe\u00adcial than dirt), but I don\u2019t see any way to do this rigor\u00adously.*or, at least, en\u00adtropy always tends to in\u00adcrease.Thomas Kwa 26 Mar 2021 21:25 UTC 3 pointsParentI agree that closed phys\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtems aren\u2019t op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems. It seems like the first patch given by the au\u00adthor works when worded more care\u00adfully: \u201cWe could stipu\u00adlate that some [low-en\u00adtropy] power source [and some en\u00adtropy sink] is pro\u00advided ex\u00adter\u00adnally to each sys\u00adtem we an\u00ada\u00adlyze, and then perform our anal\u00ady\u00adsis con\u00addi\u00adtional on the ex\u00adis\u00adtence of that power source.\u201d\nThen an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem with X bits of \u201cop\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion power\u201d (which is log(tar\u00adget states \/\u200b basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion size) or some\u00adthing) has to sink at least X bits, and this seems like it works.

In gen\u00aderal, we can quan\u00adtify how pow\u00ader\u00adful an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem is by how ro\u00adbust it is to per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions, and how small the tar\u00adget con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion set is.The bot\u00adtle cap ex\u00adam\u00adple is _not_ an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem be\u00adcause there is no broad basin of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions from which we get to the bot\u00adtle be\u00ading full of wa\u00adter. The bot\u00adtle cap doesn\u2019t cause the bot\u00adtle to be full of wa\u00adter when it didn\u2019t start out full of wa\u00adter.Op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtems are a su\u00adper\u00adset of goal-di\u00adrected agen\u00adtic sys\u00adtems, which re\u00adquire a sep\u00ada\u00adra\u00adtion be\u00adtween the op\u00adti\u00admizer and the thing be\u00ading op\u00adti\u00admized. For ex\u00adam\u00adple, a tree is cer\u00adtainly an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem (the tar\u00adget is to be a fully grown tree, and it is ro\u00adbust to per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions of soil qual\u00adity, or if you cut off a branch, etc). How\u00adever, it does not seem to be a goal-di\u00adrected agen\u00adtic sys\u00adtem, as it would be hard to sep\u00ada\u00adrate into an \u201cop\u00adti\u00admizer\u201d and a \u201cthing be\u00ading op\u00adti\u00admized\u201d.This does mean that we can no longer ask \u201cwhat is do\u00ading the op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion\u201d in an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem. This is a fea\u00adture, not a bug: if you ex\u00adpect to always be able to an\u00adswer this ques\u00adtion, you typ\u00adi\u00adcally get con\u00adfus\u00ading re\u00adsults. For ex\u00adam\u00adple, you might say that your liver is op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for mak\u00ading money, since with\u00adout it you would die and fail to make money.The full post has sev\u00aderal other ex\u00adam\u00adples that help make the con\u00adcept clearer.Planned opinion:I\u2019ve <@pre\u00advi\u00adously ar\u00adgued@>(@In\u00adtu\u00aditions about goal-di\u00adrected be\u00adhav\u00adior@) that we need to take gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adiza\u00adtion into ac\u00adcount in a defi\u00adni\u00adtion of op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion or goal-di\u00adrected be\u00adhav\u00adior.

There is one kind of AI that we can build that is highly du\u00adal\u00adis\u00adtic. Most pre\u00adsent-day AI sys\u00adtems are quite du\u00adal\u00adis\u00adtic, be\u00adcause they are pred\u00adi\u00adcated on hav\u00ading some ro\u00adbust com\u00adpute in\u00adfras\u00adtruc\u00adture that is sep\u00ada\u00adrate from and mostly un\u00adper\u00adturbed by the world around it. But there is ev\u00adery rea\u00adson to go be\u00adyond these du\u00adal\u00adis\u00adtic de\u00adsigns, for pre\u00adcisely the rea\u00adson you point to: such sys\u00adtems do tend to be some\u00adwhat brit\u00adtle.\nI think it\u2019s quite fea\u00adsi\u00adble to build highly ro\u00adbust AI sys\u00adtems, al\u00adthough do\u00ading so will likely re\u00adquire more than just hard\u00aden\u00ading (mak\u00ading it re\u00adally un\u00adlikely for the sys\u00adtem to be per\u00adturbed). What we re\u00adally want is an AI sys\u00adtem where the core AI it\u00adself tends to evolve back to a sta\u00adble con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion de\u00adspite per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions to its core in\u00adfras\u00adtruc\u00adture.

Look\u00ading at the tem\u00adper\u00ada\u00adture dis\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtion, there is a clear set of tar\u00adget states (states of uniform tem\u00adper\u00ada\u00adture) with a much larger basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion (all tem\u00adper\u00ada\u00adture dis\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtions that don\u2019t va\u00adpor\u00adize the bar).I sup\u00adpose we could con\u00adsider the sec\u00adond law of ther\u00admo\u00addy\u00adnam\u00adics to be the true op\u00adti\u00admizer in this case. The con\u00adse\u00adquence is that any* closed phys\u00adi\u00adcal sys\u00adtem is triv\u00adially an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem to\u00adwards higher en\u00adtropy.In gen\u00aderal, it seems like this op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion crite\u00adrion is very easy to satisfy if we don\u2019t spec\u00adify what ex\u00adactly we care about as a mean\u00adingful as\u00adpect of the sys\u00adtem. Even the bot\u00adtle cap \u2018op\u00adti\u00admizes\u2019 for triv\u00adial things like main\u00adtain\u00ading its shape (against the per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion of elas\u00adtic de\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion).  Do you think this will be\u00adcome a prob\u00adlem when us\u00ading this defi\u00adni\u00adtion for AI? For ex\u00adam\u00adple, we might find that a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar pro\u00adgram in\u00adci\u00adden\u00adtally tends to \u2018op\u00adti\u00admize\u2019 cer\u00adtain sim\u00adple mea\u00adsures such as the av\u00ader\u00adage mag\u00adni\u00adtude of net\u00adwork weights, or some other func\u00adtions of weights, loss, policy, etc. to a set point\/\u200brange. We may then find slightly more com\u00adplex things be\u00ading op\u00adti\u00admized that look like sub-goals (which could in a cer\u00adtain con\u00adtext be un\u00adwanted or dan\u00adger\u00adous).  How would we know where to draw the line? It seems like the defi\u00adni\u00adtion would clas\u00adsify lots of things as op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion, and it would be up to us to de\u00adcide which kinds are in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading or con\u00adcern\u00ading and which ones are as triv\u00adial as the bot\u00adtle cap main\u00adtain\u00ading its shape.That be\u00ading said, I re\u00adally like this defi\u00adni\u00adtion. I just think it should be ex\u00adtended to clas\u00adsify the in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading\u00adness of a given op\u00adti\u00admiza\u00adtion. An AI agent which com\u00adpe\u00adtently pur\u00adsues com\u00adplex goals is a much more in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading op\u00adti\u00admizer than a metal bar, even though the bar seems more ro\u00adbust (delet\u00ading a tiny piece of metal won\u2019t stop it from con\u00adduct\u00ading; delet\u00ading a tiny piece in the AI\u2019s com\u00adputer could to\u00adtally dis\u00adable it).Also a nit\u00adpick on the sec\u00adtion about whether the uni\u00adverse is an op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading sys\u00adtem:I don\u2019t think it is cor\u00adrect to say that the tar\u00adget space is al\u00admost as big as the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion. Either:We use area to rep\u00adre\u00adsent the num\u00adber of macro\u00adscopic states\u2014in this case, the tar\u00adget space is ex\u00adtremely small (one state only(?) -- an ul\u00adtra-low-den\u00adsity bath of par\u00adti\u00adcles with uniform tem\u00adper\u00ada\u00adture).  The uni\u00adverse is an ex\u00adtremely pow\u00ader\u00adful op\u00adti\u00admizer from this per\u00adspec\u00adtive, with the caveat that it takes al\u00admost for\u00adever to achieve its tar\u00adget.We use area to rep\u00adre\u00adsent the num\u00adber of micro\u00adscopic states (as I think you in\u00adtended).  In this case, I think the tar\u00adget space is ex\u00adactly iden\u00adti\u00adcal to the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion. Low en\u00adtropy microstates are not any less likely than high en\u00adtropy microstates\u2014there just hap\u00adpen to be as\u00adtro\u00adnom\u00adi\u00adcally fewer of them. There is no \u2018op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading force\u2019 push\u00ading the uni\u00adverse out of these states. From the microstate per\u00adspec\u00adtive, there is no rea\u00adson to ex\u00adclude them from the tar\u00adget zone, since any small and un\u00adre\u00admark\u00adable sub\u00adset of the tar\u00adget space will dis\u00adplay the prop\u00aderty that the sys\u00adtem tends to stum\u00adble out of it at ran\u00addom.I would say that the first lens is al\u00admost always bet\u00adter than the sec\u00adond, since macro-states are what we ac\u00adtu\u00adally care about and how we nat\u00adu\u00adrally di\u00advide the con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion space of a sys\u00adtem.Fi\u00adnally, just want to say this is an amaz\u00ading post!

For ex\u00adam\u00adple, if the bot\u00adtle cap is kept in a sealed con\u00adtainer, the wa\u00adter va\u00adpor could po\u00adten\u00adtially con\u00addense into a small pud\u00addle with the same en\u00adtropy as it had in the bot\u00adtle cap.\nIf my mem\u00adory of physics is cor\u00adrect, wa\u00adter evap\u00ado\u00adrat\u00ading would still in\u00adcreases the to\u00adtal en\u00adtropy of the to\u00adtal sys\u00adtem in which the bot\u00adtle cap is lo\u00adcated, by virtue of re\u00adleas\u00ading some heat into the en\u00advi\u00adron\u00adment .

Pretty much all con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions of the leaf would re\u00adsult in the leaf get\u00adting more yel\u00adlow over time. Is the leaf op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for yel\u00adlow-ness?What about a knife that is be\u00ading used and never sharp\u00adened? From a wide range of con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtions the knife would tend to\u00adwards get\u00adting dul\u00adler. Is it op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading dul\u00adl\u00adness?What about a space\u00adship leav\u00ading Earth? Is it op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for the dis\u00adtance from Earth?I sup\u00adpose we could con\u00adsider these things op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00aders if you re\u00adally want to. But I\u2019m con\u00adcerned that a defi\u00adni\u00adtion that in\u00adclude leaves, knives, billiard balls, and rocket ships is overly broad.More gen\u00ader\u00adally, it seems like this defi\u00adni\u00adtion clas\u00adsifies a lot of things that change in some way over time as an op\u00adti\u00admizer. In gen\u00aderal, if some\u00adthing tends to be differ\u00adent in some ways when it\u2019s young than old, then I think you can say the sys\u00adtem is an op\u00adti\u00admizer op\u00adti\u00admiz\u00ading for what\u00adever char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adis\u00adtics cor\u00adre\u00adlate with old\u00adness.

I don\u2019t think this buys you much, and seems to need\u00adlessly rule out goals based on nar\u00adrow main\u00adte\u00adnance of some sta\u00adtus-quo. Switch\u00ading to a util\u00adity func\u00adtion as sug\u00adgested by oth\u00aders im\u00adproves things, I think.For ex\u00adam\u00adple: a highly ca\u00adpa\u00adble AI whose only goal is to main\u00adtain a chess set in a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar po\u00adsi\u00adtion for as long as pos\u00adsi\u00adble, but not to care about it af\u00adter it\u2019s dis\u00adturbed.Here the tar\u00adget set is iden\u00adti\u00adcal to the basin of at\u00adtrac\u00adtion: states con\u00adtain\u00ading the chess set in the par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar po\u00adsi\u00adtion (or his\u00adto\u00adries where it\u2019s re\u00admained undis\u00adturbed).This doesn\u2019t tell us any\u00adthing about what the AI will do in pur\u00adsu\u00ading this goal. It may not do much un\u00adtil some\u00adthing ap\u00adproaches the board; it may re-ar\u00adrange the galaxy to min\u00adimise the chances that a piece will be moved (but ar\u00adbi\u00adtrar\u00adily small en\u00advi\u00adron\u00admen\u00adtal changes might have it take very differ\u00adent ac\u00adtions, so in gen\u00aderal we can\u2019t say it\u2019s op\u00adti\u00admis\u00ading for some par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar con\u00adfigu\u00adra\u00adtion of the galaxy).I want to say that this sys\u00adtem is op\u00adti\u00admis\u00ading to keep the chess set undis\u00adturbed.With util\u00adity you can eas\u00adily rep\u00adre\u00adsent this goal, and all you need to do is com\u00adpare un\u00adper\u00adturbed util\u00adity with the util\u00adity un\u00adder var\u00adi\u00adous per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtions.Some\u00adthing like: The sys\u00adtem S op\u00adti\u00admises U \ud835\udeff-ro\u00adbustly to per\u00adtur\u00adba\u00adtion x if E[U(S)] - E[U(x(S))] < \ud835\udeffBack to top","rejected":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA research workflow with Zotero and Org mode | mkbehr.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle navigation\n\n\n\n\n\nmkbehr.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout me\n\n\nArchive\n\n\nTags\n\n\nRSS feed\n\n\nGithub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA research workflow with Zotero and Org mode\n\n\n                    Michael Behr\n            \nSeptember 19, 2015\n\nComments\n\nSource\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny research project is going to involve a literature search: reading\nthrough a bunch of papers that might be relevant to your topic in\norder to get a sense of what the field already knows. Now, maybe\nthere's some magic technique for picking out the information that\nmatters, passing over the rest, and writing out a single, coherent\nstory in one pass through all the papers you can find. If that\ntechnique exists, I have no idea what it is.\nSo when every paper brings up ten new questions and twenty papers to\nstart answering them, I need a system to keep my notes organized. I\nneed notes that let me jump back and forth between papers without\nlosing my place, draw links between papers, and store lists of\ncitations to come back to. Here's how I do it.\n\nStoring papers with Zotero\nThe first tool I use is Zotero, a reference\nmanager. Zotero's job is to store all the actual papers I come across,\nalong with information like data on how to cite the papers and any\ntags they might have been published with. It can grab that information\nfrom my web browser, whether from a journal's website or someplace\nlike Google Scholar or PubMed. It's also great for quickly putting\ntogether a bibliography, using bibtex or similar programs, when I want\nto write up some results.\n\n\n\nZotero stores the papers I want to\nread and reference. I scaled up the font size here to make it readable\nin a tiny blog image.\nZotero isn't the only choice for reference managers.\nMendeley is another popular choice, and\nthere are a\nwhole bunch more\nout there. I picked Zotero arbitrarily a few years ago, but it's\nworking out well because of its emacs integration.\nKeeping notes with Emacs and Org mode\nYou see, Zotero has some note-taking functions, and I used to keep my\nnotes there, but there were some problems. Notes are stored as\nseparate files for each paper, but I want to cross-reference notes\nfrom a lot of different papers at once. And while the editor has some\nrich-text capabilities (e.g. bold and italic text), it's missing\nimportant things I need in my notes, like the ability to typeset\nequations.\nThat's where Emacs and its\nextension Org mode come in. To borrow a term\nfrom Perl enthusiasts, Org mode is the swiss army chainsaw of text\ndocument formats. Org mode documents have a lot of features, and it's\nway beyond this post's scope to describe them all. For the purpose of\nresearch notes, the most useful things it lets me do are:\n\nI can store my notes in a hierarchical tree structure, and I can\n  hide parts of the tree from view in order to focus on other parts.\nI can put hyperlinks into my notes, including links to papers,\n  websites, or other parts of the file.\nI can put math in my notes using Latex, and view the typeset\n  equations right in my Emacs buffer.\n\n\n\n\nA sample from my notes file. You\ncan see the tree structure of the file, some links to papers, and a\nlittle bit of inline math, using Latex.\nGluing it all together with zotxt\nNow, see those links to papers in my notes buffer? I didn't have to\ncopy and paste them from anywhere. I inserted them with just three\nkeystrokes each. So far, I've just described some useful pieces of\nsoftware, but the interesting part of my workflow is how they fit\ntogether.\nzotxt is an extension that lets\nother programs talk to Zotero, and Emacs has a package to talk to it.\nIt's even structured specifically to work with Org mode documents.\nWith zotxt, my workflow looks like this:\n\nI find a paper I want to look at somewhere on the internet.\nI use Zotero's browser plugin to save it to Zotero. Hopefully it\n  grabs the paper itself and this happens in one click; if the site\n  doesn't play along, I spend a minute grabbing a pdf and feeding it\n  to Zotero.\nI insert a link to the Zotero entry into my notes file in Emacs. I\n  can do this with the key chords C-c \" \". I don't need to further\n  specify what paper I want to grab: the browser plugin leaves the\n  paper selected in Zotero, and zotxt can grab the selected paper.\nWhen I want to read the paper, I go to the link and tell Emacs to\n  open the paper in my system PDF viewer. The key chords for this are\n  C-c \" a, and then selecting the PDF attachment from the Helm\n  window that appears (usually I just type pdf RET).\nWhen I'm reading a paper and see a citation that might be useful, I\n  look it up on the internet and repeat this process to store a note\n  linking to it.\n\nIt took me a while to get it set up to my liking, so here's how I did\nit:\n\nFirst, install zotxt. If you're\n  using Zotero as a firefox extension, you just need to install zotxt\n  as another extension. If you're using the standalone Zotero client,\n  you can still do it: download the extension file from that link,\n  then go to the Add-Ons Manager under the Tools menu and find the\n  option to install an add-on from a file.\n\n\n\n\nThe menu option looks like\nthis.\n\nNext, install the zotxt package in emacs. If your\n  package manager is set up, you\n  can just type M-x package-install RET zotxt RET.\nNow, when org-zotxt-mode is active, you can use its functions in\n  your org-mode buffers. You can search for papers and insert them\n  with C-c \" i, insert the currently-selected paper in Zotero with\n  C-u C-c \" i, and open a paper's PDF or other related files by\n  moving the cursor to a link and typing C-c \" a. However, you might\n  want a little bit more setup to deal with some annoyances.\nYou probably want to have org-zotxt-mode automatically activated\n  in all your org-mode documents. To make that happen, you can add\n  some code to your .emacs file to start up this mode on all your\n  org-mode buffers - see below this list for the .emacs\n  configuration I use.\nIf you want to insert a link to the currently-selected item a lot,\n  C-u C-c \" i is an awkward sequence to type. I rebound it to C-c \"\n  \".\nYou might notice that when you insert a link to a paper, the text of\n  that link is a full citation. That might be what you want, but I\n  just want the authors, paper name, and year. It took me a bit of\n  hacking to get around that: it's possible to tell the emacs zotxt\n  interface to use a different citation format than the default, but I\n  had to throw together a little XML file to give it a shorter format\n  than a full citation. (This may not be the easiest or cleanest way\n  to do it, but it works!)\n  That XML file is here. To use it, go into\n  your Zotero preferences and select Cite -> Styles, and add the file.\n  It should appear in the menu as \"mkbehr's short reference format\".\n  Then add the last two lines in the .emacs snippet below, and you\n  should get shorter citations.\nYou probably want to install the\n  Helm package, to make zotxt's\n  search interface easier to navigate. That link should tell you\n  everything you need to know.\n\nHere's that .emacs setup code:\n;; Activate org-zotxt-mode in org-mode buffers\n(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-zotxt-mode 1)))\n;; Bind something to replace the awkward C-u C-c \" i\n(define-key org-mode-map\n  (kbd \"C-c \\\" \\\"\") (lambda () (interactive)\n                      (org-zotxt-insert-reference-link '(4))))\n;; Change citation format to be less cumbersome in files.\n;; You'll need to install mkbehr-short into your style manager first.\n(eval-after-load \"zotxt\"\n'(setq zotxt-default-bibliography-style \"mkbehr-short\"))\n\nOf course, I'm not done tinkering to make my workflow better. I hear\ngood things about the org-ref\nand helm-bibtex\npackages - if only I can keep an up-to-date bibtex file as I add papers\nto my library, I can associate links with not only a paper's pdf, but\nalso that paper's section of my notes file. And I haven't found a\nsmooth way to take a paper and pull up the papers it cites in my\nbrowser. But until then, I'm pretty happy with this setup.\nHappy researching!\n\n\n\nemacs\nresearch\n\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\nNext post\n\nComments\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nComments powered by Disqus\n\n\n\n\n            Contents \u00a9 2015         Michael Behr - Powered by         Nikola\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"chosen":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRent Seeking - Econlib\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberty Fund Network\n\nEconlib\nLiberty Fund\nOLL\nAdam Smith Works\nLaw & Liberty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconLog\n\nBlog\nBrowse by Author\nBrowse by Topic\nSearch EconLog\nRSS\nSubscribe\n\n\nEconTalk\n\nLatest Episodes\nBrowse by Date\nBrowse by Guest\nBrowse by Category\nBrowse Extras\nSearch EconTalk\nRSS Feeds\n\n\nArticles\n\nLatest Articles\nLiberty Classics\nBrowse by Author\nBrowse by Date\nSearch Articles\n\n\nBooks\n\nBooks\nBios\nBooks by Date\nBooks by Author\nSearch Books\n\n\nEncyclopedia\n\nIndex\nBrowse by Author\nBrowse by Title\nBiographies\nSearch Encyclopedia\n\n\nGuides\n\nIndex\n#ECONLIBREADS\nCollege Topics\nHigh School Topics\nSubscribe to QuickPicks\nSearch Guides\n\n\nVideos\n\nIndex\nSearch Videos\n\n\nLiberty Fund Network\n\nEconlib\nOLL\nAdam Smith Works\nLibrary of Law & Liberty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\u00a0 \/ \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECONLIB CEE\n\n\n                                Government Policy                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRent Seeking\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy David R.

Gordon Tullock originated the idea in 1967, and Anne Krueger introduced the label in 1974. The idea is simple but powerful. People are said to seek rents when they try to obtain benefits for themselves through the political arena. They typically do so by getting a subsidy for a good they produce or for being in a particular class of people, by getting a tariff on a good they produce, or by getting a special regulation that hampers their competitors. Elderly people, for example, often seek higher Social Security payments; steel producers often seek restrictions on imports of steel; and licensed electricians and doctors often lobby to keep regulations in place that restrict competition from unlicensed electricians or doctors.\n\n\n\nBut why do economists use the term \u201crent\u201d? Unfortunately, there is no good reason. David Ricardo introduced the term \u201crent\u201d in economics. It means the payment to a factor of production in excess of what is required to keep that factor in its present use. So, for example, if I am paid $150,000 in my current job but I would stay in that job for any salary over $130,000, I am making $20,000 in rent. What is wrong with rent seeking? Absolutely nothing. I would be rent seeking if I asked for a raise. My employer would then be free to decide if my services are worth it. Even though I am seeking rents by asking for a raise, this is not what economists mean by \u201crent seeking.\u201d They use the term to describe people\u2019s lobbying of government to give them special privileges. A much better term is \u201cprivilege seeking.\u201d\n\n\nIt has been known for centuries that people lobby the government for privileges. Tullock\u2019s insight was that expenditures on lobbying for privileges are costly and that these expenditures, therefore, dissipate some of the gains to the beneficiaries and cause inefficiency. If, for example, a steel firm spends one million dollars lobbying and advertising for restrictions on steel imports, whatever money it gains by succeeding, presumably more than one million, is not a net gain. From this gain must be subtracted the one-million-dollar cost of seeking the restrictions. Although such an expenditure is rational from the narrow viewpoint of the firm that spends it, it represents a use of real resources to get a transfer from others and is therefore a pure loss to the economy as a whole.\n\n\nKrueger (1974) independently discovered the idea in her study of poor economies whose governments heavily regulated their people\u2019s economic lives. She pointed out that the regulation was so extensive that the government had the power to create \u201crents\u201d equal to a large percentage of national income. For India in 1964, for example, Krueger estimated that government regulation created rents equal to 7.3 percent of national income; for Turkey in 1968, she estimated that rents from import licenses alone were about 15 percent of Turkey\u2019s gross national product. Krueger did not attempt to estimate what percentage of these rents were dissipated in the attempt to get them. Tullock (1993) tentatively maintained that expenditures on rent-seeking in democracies are not very large.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDavid R. Henderson is the editor of this encyclopedia.

When combined with computation, it gives rise to the area of convex optimization that has had a huge impact on understanding and improving the world we live in. However, convexity does not provide all the answers. Many procedures in statistics, machine learning and nature at large\u2014Bayesian inference, deep learning, protein folding\u2014successfully solve non-convex problems that are NP-hard, i.e., intractable on worst-case instances. Moreover, often nature or humans choose methods that are inefficient in the worst case to solve problems in P.\nCan we develop a theory to resolve this mismatch between reality and the predictions of worst-case analysis?  Such a theory could identify structure in natural inputs that helps sidestep worst-case complexity.\nThis blog is dedicated to the idea that optimization methods\u2014whether created by humans or nature, whether convex or nonconvex\u2014are exciting objects of study and, often lead to useful algorithms and insights into nature. This study can be seen as an extension of classical mathematical fields such as dynamical systems and differential equations among others, but with the important addition of the notion of computational efficiency.\nWe will report on interesting research directions and open problems, and highlight progress that has been made. We will write articles ourselves as well as encourage others to contribute. In doing so, we hope to generate an active dialog between theorists, scientists and practitioners and to motivate a generation of young researchers to work on these important problems.\nContributing an article\nIf you\u2019re writing an article for this blog, please follow these guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Theme available on Github.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
