WHAT MAKES IT IMPORTANT?\\n\\n\\n\\n In the News [ 22 ] \\n \\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0 \\n Contributors [ 199 ] \\n \\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0 \\n View All Responses [ 199 ]  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n Pamela McCorduck \\n Author, Machines Who Think, The Universal Machine, Bounded Rationality, This Could Be Important; Co-author (with Edward Feigenbaum), The Fifth Generation  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n Identifying The Principles, Perhaps The Laws, Of Intelligence \\n The most important news for me came in mid-2015, when three scientists, Samuel J. Gershman, Eric J. Horvitz, and Joshua Tenenbaum published “Computational rationality: A converging paradigm for intelligence in brains, minds, and machines” in Science, 17 July 2015. They announced that they and their colleagues had something new underway: an effort to identify the principles, perhaps the laws, of intelligence, just as Newton once discovered the laws of motion.\\nFormerly, any commonalities among a stroll in the park, the turbulence of a river, the revolution of a carriage wheel, the trajectory of a cannon ball, or the paths of the planets, seemed preposterous. It was Newton who found the underlying generalities that explained each of them (and so much more) at a fundamental level.\\nNow comes a similarly audacious pursuit to subsume under general principles, perhaps even laws, the essence of intelligence wherever it’s found. “Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things,” Newton said.\\nSo far as intelligence goes, we are pre-Newtonian. Commonalities of intelligence shared by cells, dolphins, plants, birds, robots and humans seem, if not preposterous, at least far-fetched.\\nYet rich exchanges among artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and the neurosciences, for a start, aim exactly toward Newton’s “truth in simplicity,” those underlying principles (maybe laws) that will connect these disparate entities together. The pursuit’s formal name is computational rationality. What is it exactly, we ask? Who, or what, exhibits it?\\n\\xa0The pursuit is inspired by the general agreement in the sciences of mind that intelligence arises not from the medium that embodies it—whether biological or electronic—but the way interactions among elements in the system are arranged. Intelligence begins when a system identifies a goal, learns (from a teacher, a training set, or an experience) and then moves on autonomously, adapting to a complex, changing environment. Another way of looking at this is that intelligent entities are networks, often hierarchies of intelligent systems, humans certainly among the most complex, but congeries of humans even more so.\\nThe three scientists postulate that three core ideas characterize intelligence. First, intelligent agents have goals, and form beliefs and plan actions that will best reach those goals. Second, calculating ideal best choices may be intractable for real-world problems, but rational algorithms can come close enough (“satisfice” in Herbert Simon’s term) and incorporate the costs of computation. Third, these algorithms can be rationally adapted to the entity’s specific needs, either off-line through engineering or evolutionary design, or online through meta-reasoning mechanisms that select the best strategy on the spot for a given situation.\\nThough barely begun, the inquiry into computational rationality is already large and embraces multitudes. For example, biologists now talk easily about cognition, from the cellular to the symbolic level. Neuroscientists can identify computational strategies shared by both humans and animals. Dendrologists can show that trees communicate with each other (slowly) to warn of nearby enemies, like wood beetles: activate the toxins, neighbor.\\nThe humanities themselves are comfortably at home here too, though it’s taken many years for most of us to see that. And of course here belongs artificial intelligence, a key illuminator, inspiration, and provocateur.\\nIt’s news now; it will stay news because it’s so fundamental; its evolving revelations will help us see our world, our universe, in a completely new way. And for those atremble at the perils of super-intelligent entities, surely understanding intelligence at this fundamental level is one of our best defenses.\\xa0\\n \\n Return to Table of Contents  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n 2018 : WHAT IS THE LAST QUESTION?  \\n\\n  \\n 2017 : WHAT SCIENTIFIC TERM OR\\xa0CONCEPT OUGHT TO BE MORE WIDELY KNOWN?  \\n\\n  \\n 2016 : WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE MOST INTERESTING RECENT [SCIENTIFIC] NEWS?

This post doesn’t cover ev\\xadery\\xadthing rele\\xadvant to the topic, but I am con\\xadfi\\xaddent that ev\\xadery\\xadthing pre\\xadsented is solid.You may have no\\xadticed that plan\\xadning can be rather difficult. Granted, not all plans are difficult, plan\\xadning what you’re go\\xading to have for din\\xadner isn’t too bad usu\\xadally; how\\xadever se\\xadri\\xadous plan\\xadning can range from merely daunt\\xading to seem\\xadingly in\\xadtractable. Think of the challenge of plan\\xadning to\\xadwards a satis\\xadfy\\xading ca\\xadreer, a fulfilling re\\xadla\\xadtion\\xadship, the suc\\xadcess of your startup, or the sim\\xadple preser\\xadva\\xadtion and flour\\xadish\\xading of hu\\xadman civ\\xadi\\xadliza\\xadtion.

The point not be\\xading that we should give up be\\xadcause plan\\xadning is fu\\xadtile. Far from it. With a de\\xadtailed model of the fac\\xadtors which make plan\\xadning hard, we can de\\xadrive a unified roadmap for how to get bet\\xadter at plan\\xadning and ul\\xadti\\xadmately have a unified, pow\\xader\\xadful ap\\xadproach to mak\\xading bet\\xadter plans.ContentsWhat is plan\\xadning?Plan\\xadning is a pre\\xaddic\\xadtion/\\u200bin\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion problemPlan\\xadning is a com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtion problemPlan\\xadning is a self-knowl\\xadedge and self-mas\\xadtery problemPlan\\xadning is a re\\xadcur\\xadsive problemSum\\xadmary: what it takes to be a good plannerAp\\xadpendix: math\\xade\\xadmat\\xadi\\xadcal for\\xadmal\\xadism of the com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtion problemWhat is plan\\xadning? We can’t talk about why plan\\xadning is hard be\\xadfore clar\\xadify what plan\\xadning is. It’s pretty sim\\xadple:Plan\\xadning is the se\\xadlec\\xadtion of ac\\xadtions in or\\xadder to achieve de\\xadsired out\\xadcomes. [1] The need for plan\\xadning arises when the fol\\xadlow\\xading con\\xaddi\\xadtions hold:There are mul\\xadti\\xadple states that the world can be in.You have prefer\\xadences over which states the world is in.There are mul\\xadti\\xadple ac\\xadtions available to you, each of which might cause the world to more likely be in some states rather than oth\\xaders.You can\\xadnot take all of the ac\\xadtions, ei\\xadther be\\xadcause you lack the re\\xadsources to do so or be\\xadcause the ac\\xadtions are in\\xadher\\xadently ex\\xadclu\\xadsive.Th\\xadese con\\xaddi\\xadtions lead to a re\\xadfine\\xadment of the defi\\xadni\\xadtion above: plan\\xadning is the se\\xadlec\\xadtion of ac\\xadtions from among com\\xadpet\\xading al\\xadter\\xadna\\xadtives. One must pri\\xadori\\xadtize among one’s available op\\xadtions and al\\xadlo\\xadcate re\\xadsources to whichever op\\xadtions rank most highly. Often one is al\\xadlo\\xadcat\\xading re\\xadsources among mul\\xadti\\xadple op\\xadtions in pro\\xadpor\\xadtion to their pri\\xador\\xadity, but I think we can still rightly call it pri\\xadori\\xadti\\xadza\\xadtion even when one is only de\\xadcid\\xading be\\xadtween al\\xadlo\\xadcat\\xading 100% of their re\\xadsources to only one op\\xadtion of out two. In other words, all of plan\\xadning is pri\\xadori\\xadti\\xadza\\xadtion. [2]Plan\\xadning is a Pre\\xaddic\\xadtion/\\u200bIn\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion ProblemOn what ba\\xadsis should we se\\xadlect or pri\\xadori\\xadtize one ac\\xadtion over an\\xadother? Of course, we should se\\xadlect whichever ac\\xadtions we most ex\\xadpect to lead us to the wor\\xadlds we most pre\\xadfer. We should choose ac\\xadtions based on the Ex\\xadpected Value (EV) we as\\xadsign to them.And therein lies one of the core challenges of plan\\xadning. Ex\\xadpect\\xading is just an\\xadother word for pre\\xaddict\\xading. And pre\\xaddict\\xading is just a word which means as\\xadsign\\xading each ac\\xadtion a prob\\xada\\xadbil\\xadity dis\\xadtri\\xadbu\\xadtion over the world states it will re\\xadsult in. That’s hard to do well.Plan\\xadning is hard be\\xadcause pre\\xaddict\\xading is hard. Of course, pre\\xaddict\\xading is a lot eas\\xadier when you have more in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion, but usu\\xadally we have far less than we’d like, so plan\\xadning is hard be\\xadcause of limited in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion. Plan\\xadning is a pre\\xaddic\\xadtion prob\\xadlem and an in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion prob\\xadlem. Peo\\xadple of think of plan\\xadning as be\\xading about “do\\xading”, but in truth plan\\xadning is just as much about “know\\xading”. One thing this amounts to is that the in\\xadstru\\xadmen\\xadtal ra\\xadtio\\xadnal\\xadity in\\xadvolved in plan\\xadning is in\\xadsep\\xada\\xadrable from the epistemic ra\\xadtio\\xadnal\\xadity of hav\\xading true be\\xadliefs, good mod\\xadels, and mak\\xading ac\\xadcu\\xadrate pre\\xaddic\\xadtions. Any plan\\xadner’s abil\\xadity is go\\xading to be capped by their epistemic skill.What we can do with this re\\xadal\\xadiza\\xadtion is that in any situ\\xada\\xadtion where we’re plan\\xadning, we can pay de\\xadliber\\xadate at\\xadten\\xadtion to the pre\\xaddic\\xadtions we need to make, the in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion we have, and ways in which might be able to make bet\\xadter pre\\xaddic\\xadtions. (I call this the In\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion Con\\xadtext of a plan.) Alter\\xadna\\xadtively stated, one can be\\xadgin to ap\\xadproach plan\\xadning with an un\\xadcer\\xadtainty re\\xadduc\\xadtion mind\\xadset [3]. Rather than al\\xadlo\\xadcat\\xading all of one’s re\\xadsources from the out\\xadset, one in\\xadstead al\\xadlo\\xadcates a por\\xadtion of the re\\xadsources to\\xadwards “pur\\xadchas\\xading” in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion which im\\xadproves the sub\\xadse\\xadquent al\\xadlo\\xadca\\xadtion of the rest via im\\xadproved pre\\xaddic\\xadtion. We do this already in many cases (read\\xading re\\xadviews, ask\\xading friends, tri\\xadals), but the oc\\xadca\\xadsions where we fail to do this can cost us big time: the stu\\xaddent who didn’t re\\xadsearch be\\xadfore start\\xading law school, the com\\xadpany that spent years de\\xadvel\\xadop\\xading a product be\\xadfore test\\xading with users, the cou\\xadple who rushed into mar\\xadriage, etc. (Not the only cause, but emo\\xadtions of\\xadten make us im\\xadpa\\xadtient to go all out with an op\\xadtion with\\xadout ad\\xade\\xadquate con\\xadsid\\xader\\xada\\xadtion.)Un\\xadfor\\xadtu\\xadnately, while it’s easy to say that get\\xadting more in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion and re\\xadduc\\xading un\\xadcer\\xadtainty is a good thing, there’s still a lot of com\\xadplex\\xadity in man\\xadag\\xading un\\xadcer\\xadtainty. Know\\xading how much is okay and how to effi\\xadciently re\\xadduce it. Still, always re\\xadmem\\xadber\\xading that pre\\xaddic\\xadtion is a core challenge of plan\\xadning is a start.Plan\\xadning is a Com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtion ProblemUn\\xadfor\\xadtu\\xadnately, even hav\\xading all the right in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion and perfect pre\\xaddic\\xadtion would not be enough to make plan\\xadning easy. Even when one can perfectly pre\\xaddict the out\\xadcome of all al\\xadter\\xadna\\xadtive op\\xadtions, plan\\xadning of\\xadten gives rise to in\\xadtractably large com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtional prob\\xadlems which are NP-Com\\xadplete. (I provide a small math\\xade\\xadmat\\xadi\\xadcal treat\\xadment in this com\\xadment be\\xadlow.)We are usu\\xadally al\\xadlo\\xadcat\\xading a finite set of re\\xadsources (our time, our money) amount a set of op\\xadtions in or\\xadder to ac\\xadcom\\xadplish a va\\xadri\\xadety of goals. Ex\\xadam\\xadple: I might care about my health, en\\xadter\\xadtain\\xadment, ca\\xadreer, friend\\xadships, ro\\xadmance, art, and ed\\xadu\\xadca\\xadtion. Towards these val\\xadues, I could in a given week: sleep, play ten\\xadnis, go to the gym, watch Net\\xadflix, work late, call up by bestie, go on Tin\\xadder, draw a pic\\xadture, read a text\\xadbook, etc. I get to al\\xadlo\\xadcate my time to some com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtion of ac\\xadtivi\\xadties, but the thing is, the num\\xadber of pos\\xadsi\\xadble com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtions for al\\xadlo\\xadcat\\xading my time in a sin\\xadgle week is mind-bog\\xadgling. A su\\xadper-sim\\xadplified ex\\xadam\\xadple: I have 30 dis\\xadcre\\xadtionary hours in a week and 10 pos\\xadsi\\xadble ac\\xadtivi\\xadties I could spend each of those hours on, but I only spend time on ac\\xadtivi\\xadties in two-hour blocks. This re\\xadsults in 10^(30/\\u200b2) = 10^15 = one thou\\xadsand trillion differ\\xadent com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtions of how I could spend my time that week. Even if I could perfectly pre\\xaddict how much I’d like each com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtion of time us\\xadage, I could never con\\xadsider them all ex\\xadplic\\xaditly. This com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtional com\\xadplex\\xadity was very salient to me in my last job as a Product Man\\xadager where ev\\xadery six weeks I would choose which pro\\xadjects my team of Data Scien\\xadtists would work on. Un\\xadder ideal cir\\xadcum\\xadstances, I might get to choose ten pro\\xadjects out of a can\\xaddi\\xaddate twenty pro\\xadjects. Choos\\xading was hard, es\\xadpe\\xadcially since in ad\\xaddi\\xadtion to pure value of each pro\\xadject, I had to jug\\xadgle the facts that: a) pro\\xadjects were of\\xadten not in\\xadde\\xadpen\\xaddent, b) pro\\xadjects of\\xadten have fu\\xadture costs, e.g. main\\xadte\\xadnance and tech debt, c) there are costs to not do\\xading or de\\xadlay\\xading some pro\\xadjects, d) the benefits of differ\\xadent pro\\xadjects are spread over differ\\xadent time hori\\xadzons, e) pro\\xadjects aren’t com\\xadmen\\xadsu\\xadrate, e.g. pro\\xadtect\\xading down\\xadside risk vs build\\xading new func\\xadtion\\xadal\\xadity, f) some pro\\xadjects are nec\\xades\\xadsary to pre\\xadserve fu\\xadture op\\xadtion\\xadal\\xadity, g) bud\\xadget con\\xadstraints were soft, I could some\\xadtimes steal time from el\\xadse\\xadwhere it meant I could se\\xadlect a bet\\xadter set of pro\\xadjects.Even if I’d had perfect in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion and pre\\xaddic\\xadtion, which I cer\\xadtainly didn’t, the num\\xadber of pos\\xadsi\\xadbil\\xadities was large enough to be in\\xadtractable by any an\\xada\\xadlyt\\xadi\\xadcal method of pri\\xadori\\xadti\\xadza\\xadtion.I am least cer\\xadtain about how to best tackle the com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtion prob\\xadlem of plan\\xadning, but my cur\\xadrent guess is that very much re\\xadlies on effec\\xadtively us\\xading our in\\xadstinc\\xadtive, in\\xadtu\\xaditive, Sys\\xadtem 1 think\\xading in con\\xadjunc\\xadtion with our Sys\\xadtem 2 think\\xading. Sys\\xadtem 1 is bet\\xadter at han\\xaddling prob\\xadlems too large to be con\\xadsciously con\\xadsid\\xadered, while Sys\\xadtem 2 can en\\xadsure that Sys\\xadtem 1 is pay\\xading at\\xadten\\xadtion to all the rele\\xadvant con\\xadsid\\xader\\xada\\xadtions. I like cost-benefit analy\\xadses and de\\xadci\\xadsion-ma\\xadtri\\xadces not be\\xadcause I think they should make the fi\\xadnal de\\xadci\\xadsion, but be\\xadcause I think the ex\\xader\\xadcise of cre\\xadat\\xading them loads the right in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion into Sys\\xadtem 1.Plan\\xadning is a Self-Knowl\\xadedge & Self-Mastery ProblemIn a three-fold man\\xadner, plan\\xadning is a prob\\xadlem of self-knowl\\xadedge and self-mas\\xadtery.Pre\\xaddict\\xading yourselfThe first prob\\xadlem of plan\\xadning stated was that of pre\\xaddic\\xadtion and in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion. With the ex\\xadcep\\xadtion of plans made for teams, or\\xadga\\xadni\\xadza\\xadtions, coun\\xadtries, and the like, your plans will con\\xadcern your\\xadself and your ac\\xadtions. That means that in\\xadvari\\xadably one of the most im\\xadpor\\xadtant things to be able to pre\\xaddict is your\\xadself. Some\\xadtimes this is hard be\\xadcause we lack in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion. It might be hard to pre\\xaddict how you will be\\xadhave or feel in novel cir\\xadcum\\xadstances. Other times it can be hard to pre\\xaddict our\\xadselves be\\xadcause we are averse to mak\\xading the best pos\\xadsi\\xadble pre\\xaddic\\xadtions we could. We re\\xadfuse to ad\\xadmit that re\\xadal\\xadis\\xadti\\xadcally we are not go\\xading to get up at 6am to go to the gym.A par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar as\\xadpect of your\\xadself which it is key to be able to pre\\xaddict is your mo\\xadti\\xadva\\xadtion. Plans which rely on un\\xadre\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic pre\\xaddic\\xadtions about how mo\\xadti\\xadvated you will feel while ex\\xade\\xadcut\\xading the plans are prob\\xada\\xadbly go\\xading to be un\\xadsuc\\xadcess\\xadful plans.Ad\\xadvice I have for this as\\xadpect of plan\\xadning is a) start pay\\xading at\\xadten\\xadtion to your\\xadself and to pre\\xaddict\\xading your\\xadself, for\\xadtu\\xadnately usu\\xadally you have a lot of data to work with, b) adopt a policy of rad\\xadi\\xadcal-self hon\\xadesty, what is true is already so and good pre\\xaddic\\xadtions are the ba\\xadsis of good plans.Know\\xading what you wantThis post started with the defi\\xadni\\xadtion that plan\\xadning is the se\\xadlec\\xadtion of ac\\xadtions to\\xadwards de\\xadsired out\\xadcomes. It is rather im\\xadpor\\xadtant that you cor\\xadrectly iden\\xadtify your ac\\xadtual de\\xadsired out\\xadcomes, oth\\xader\\xadwise, any ac\\xadtions you se\\xadlect aren’t likely to be worth much. “I thought I wanted X ac\\xadtu\\xadally but I didn’t” is too of\\xadten the foil of a sup\\xadpos\\xadedly suc\\xadcess\\xadful plan where the plan\\xadner ev\\xadi\\xaddently lacked good self-pre\\xaddic\\xadtion.I’m of the be\\xadlief that one’s deep-down de\\xadsired out\\xadcomes (per\\xadsonal and moral) are con\\xadtained in\\xadside one’s brain, re\\xadgard\\xadless of whether one has achieved good con\\xadscious ac\\xadcess to them or in\\xadferred all the con\\xadse\\xadquences of them. Much of good plan\\xadning is re\\xadduc\\xading un\\xadcer\\xadtainty around what is that you ac\\xadtu\\xadally want and value. Self-pre\\xaddic\\xadtion is a spe\\xadcial case of the gen\\xaderal pre\\xaddic\\xadtion/\\u200bin\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion prob\\xadlem, but it re\\xadquires differ\\xadent tech\\xadniques of un\\xadcer\\xadtainty re\\xadduc\\xadtion than out\\xadside-world pre\\xaddic\\xadtion does. In\\xadtro\\xadspec\\xadtive meth\\xadods such as med\\xadi\\xadta\\xadtion, Fo\\xadcus\\xading, In\\xadter\\xadnal Fam\\xadily Sys\\xadtems, etc. are helpful for hav\\xading bet\\xadter knowl\\xadedge of which out\\xadcomes you ac\\xadtu\\xadally want.Of course, com\\xadpli\\xadcat\\xading the dis\\xadcov\\xadery of what your de\\xadsired out\\xadcomes are is that the no\\xadtion of you may be a lit\\xadtle com\\xadpli\\xadcated. I have been per\\xadsuaded over the years that it can be very use\\xadful to think of your\\xadself as be\\xading made up of parts or sub-agents, each with their own par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar de\\xadsires. Mas\\xadter\\xading your\\xadself means com\\xading to un\\xadder\\xadstand your parts and their de\\xadsires lead\\xading into an abil\\xadity to make plans that satisfy all your\\xadself. This can be cru\\xadcial as mak\\xading plans which parts of you are not on\\xadboard of\\xadten causes those parts to un\\xadder\\xadmine the plan.Re\\xadlat\\xadedly, “mak\\xading your\\xadself do some\\xadthing” should always be a warn\\xading sign that some part of you is be\\xading dis\\xadre\\xadgarded. Some\\xadtimes that’s le\\xadgi\\xadt\\xadi\\xadmate, but re\\xadally only if you’re ac\\xadcount\\xading for it in your self-pre\\xaddic\\xadtions and how it’s go\\xading to af\\xadfect over\\xadall suc\\xadcess. Self-mas\\xadtery of your hu\\xadman brainHu\\xadman brains are re\\xadally, re\\xadally good, but they’re also re\\xadally com\\xadpli\\xadcated with a lot of differ\\xadent mov\\xading pieces and no user man\\xadual. Most of us man\\xadage, but there are gains to be had from bet\\xadter at op\\xader\\xadat\\xading our own minds.Heuris\\xadtics and biasesTo get bet\\xadter at pre\\xaddict\\xading, it helps to un\\xadder\\xadstand when our brains na\\xadtively do and don’t make good pre\\xaddic\\xadtions of their own ac\\xadcord. That leads di\\xadrectly into heuris\\xadtics and bi\\xadases and at\\xadtempts to be\\xadcome a lens which sees its flaws.Us\\xading Sys\\xadtem 1 (in\\xadtu\\xadition) and Sys\\xadtem 2 (ex\\xadplicit rea\\xadson) in harmonyHu\\xadman brains run on both and each sys\\xadtem has its ad\\xadvan\\xadtages and dis\\xadad\\xadvan\\xadtages. The hu\\xadman who is lev\\xader\\xadag\\xading their brain to its ful\\xadlest ex\\xadtent is us\\xading all of their mind in har\\xadmony, not priv\\xadileg\\xading or dis\\xadre\\xadgard\\xading one kind of think\\xading in\\xadap\\xadpro\\xadpri\\xadately. This hard though, but re\\xadally a key part of get\\xadting good at plan\\xadning. Emo\\xadtional MasteryAr\\xadguably emo\\xadtions could be lumped un\\xadder Sys\\xadtem 1, but it’s worth call\\xading them out sep\\xada\\xadrately. While emo\\xadtions serve mul\\xadti\\xadple pur\\xadposes, one of the things they do is carry an im\\xadpor\\xadtant sig\\xadnal of in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion from your sub\\xadcon\\xadscious mind. If you feel anx\\xadious about some\\xadthing or hav\\xading a nig\\xadgling doubt or what\\xadever, that’s be\\xadcause there’s a part of your mind has been pro\\xadcess\\xading raw data and find\\xading it sig\\xadnifi\\xadcant. The skil\\xadled plan\\xadner and pre\\xaddic\\xadtor will be some\\xadone who can ex\\xadtract that valuable in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion from their emo\\xadtions.How\\xadever, emo\\xadtional mas\\xadtery is per\\xadhaps even more im\\xadpor\\xadtant to plan\\xadning in an\\xadother way. Many, many plans are bad plans be\\xadcause peo\\xadple lapse into op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for their emo\\xadtions rather than ac\\xadtual long-term de\\xadsired out\\xadcomes. A per\\xadson who rushes into a plan with in\\xadad\\xade\\xadquate in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion be\\xadcause they dis\\xadlike be\\xading in a state of in\\xadde\\xadci\\xadsion is likely choos\\xading a worse plan be\\xadcause they were un\\xadable to han\\xaddle their un\\xadpleas\\xadant emo\\xadtions. Or a per\\xadson who only ex\\xade\\xadcutes ex\\xadtremely con\\xadser\\xadva\\xadtive plans be\\xadcause any\\xadthing bold makes them too feel anx\\xadious. I be\\xadlieve schools of thought which help with emo\\xadtional mas\\xadtery such as ACT, CBT, and DBT have a place among the train\\xading ma\\xadte\\xadri\\xadals for great plan\\xadners.Plan\\xadning is a Re\\xadcur\\xadsive ProblemWe’ve cov\\xadered that plan\\xadning re\\xadquires iden\\xadti\\xadfy\\xading your op\\xadtions, pre\\xaddict\\xading their out\\xadcomes, eval\\xadu\\xadat\\xading the good\\xadness of said out\\xadcomes, and then some\\xadhow crunch\\xading through all the differ\\xadent com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtions of pos\\xadsi\\xadble ac\\xadtions to se\\xadlect the best over\\xadall set. Ex\\xadcept plan\\xadning is re\\xadcur\\xadsive. Any difficult plan is go\\xading to be com\\xadposed of mul\\xadti\\xadple sub-plans and for each one of those sub-plans the whole pro\\xadcess needs to re\\xadpeated again: iden\\xadti\\xadfy\\xading op\\xadtions, mak\\xading pre\\xaddic\\xadtions, se\\xadlect\\xading com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtions, etc.First, this adds to the already ex\\xadten\\xadsive amount of com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtion in\\xadvolved in plan\\xadning. Se\\xadcond, it can of\\xadten cause plans to span mul\\xadti\\xadple do\\xadmains strain\\xading all but the most ver\\xadsa\\xadtile gen\\xader\\xadal\\xadists. Have pity for the as\\xadpiring baker whose plan was to make the best muffins in town, but now has to figure out dou\\xadble-en\\xadtry ac\\xadcount\\xading and US tax code. Or the physi\\xadcist-cum-founder who wanted to cre\\xadate clean en\\xadergy tech\\xadnolo\\xadgies but now needs to figure out a sales and mar\\xadket\\xading strat\\xadegy too.At a base level, the challenges of good plan\\xadning re\\xadmain con\\xadstant be\\xadtween do\\xadmains, e.g. mak\\xading good pre\\xaddic\\xadtions, as well the ad\\xadvis\\xadable steps, e.g. re\\xadduc\\xading un\\xadcer\\xadtainty. Yet the con\\xadcrete steps for do\\xading these might look very differ\\xadent. The physi\\xadcist-founder might have been very good at re\\xadduc\\xading un\\xadcer\\xadtainty in the lab\\xado\\xadra\\xadtory with ex\\xadper\\xadi\\xadments, but the feed\\xadback loop for iter\\xadat\\xading on sales strat\\xadegy might be com\\xadpletely differ\\xadent, even if in both cases you’re try\\xading to re\\xadduce un\\xadcer\\xadtainty.Shift\\xading be\\xadtween do\\xadmains is prob\\xada\\xadbly a rea\\xadson why peo\\xadple who are good at re\\xadduc\\xading un\\xadcer\\xadtainty and plan\\xadning in some do\\xadmains are neg\\xadli\\xadgent in oth\\xaders. Ar\\xadguably, the skil\\xadled plan\\xadner is go\\xading to figure out the right spe\\xadcific tech\\xadniques to achieve good plans across all the do\\xadmains they touch. In some do\\xadmains, you might have lots of ex\\xadperts you can poll; in oth\\xaders it might be cheap to run ex\\xadper\\xadi\\xadments; in some you can build good ex\\xadplicit mod\\xadels; in oth\\xaders it’s all about train\\xading in\\xadtu\\xadition; and yet in fur\\xadther cases it might not be easy at all and you’re left try\\xading to draw ten\\xadu\\xadous in\\xadfer\\xadences from his\\xadtor\\xadi\\xadcal ex\\xadam\\xadple.Sum\\xadmary: What It Takes to Be a Great PlannerWe can neatly sum\\xadma\\xadrize why plan\\xadning can be so difficult with a list of all the traits one should have in or\\xadder to over\\xadcome the difficul\\xadties.One must be ex\\xadcel\\xadlent at mak\\xading pre\\xaddic\\xadtions across do\\xadmains, helped by their mas\\xadtery of epistemic skill and virtue.One must be skil\\xadled at iden\\xadti\\xadfy\\xading which in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion one needs yet lacks and at ex\\xade\\xadcut\\xading sub-plans to effi\\xadciently ob\\xadtain this in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion across differ\\xadent do\\xadmains and the dis\\xadparate tech\\xadniques re\\xadquired to do so.One must be skil\\xadled at mak\\xading choices within com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadto\\xadri\\xadally ex\\xadplo\\xadsive prob\\xadlems in\\xadvolv\\xading the se\\xadlec\\xadtion of com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtions of mul\\xadti\\xadple op\\xadtions to\\xadwards mul\\xadti\\xadple goals via the use of heuris\\xadtics, ex\\xadcel\\xadlent in\\xadtu\\xadition/\\u200bin\\xadstinct, or some other re\\xadli\\xadable method.One must be able to make use of their Sys\\xadtem 1 and Sys\\xadtem 2 to think in har\\xadmony.One must have knowl\\xadedge of their true val\\xadues, goals, and de\\xadsired states of the world.One must have knowl\\xadedge of their sub-parts and al\\xadign\\xadment be\\xadtween them so that one does not un\\xadder\\xadmine one\\xadself.One must be able to pre\\xaddict one’s own be\\xadhav\\xadior in\\xadclud\\xading the be\\xadhav\\xadior of one’s mo\\xadti\\xadva\\xadtions and emo\\xadtions so that one can plan effec\\xadtively around them.One must be able to re\\xadduce un\\xadcer\\xadtainty about one’s self-model via ex\\xadper\\xadi\\xadments or in\\xadtro\\xadspec\\xadtive tools.One must be able to listen to the in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion con\\xadtained in their emo\\xadtions.One must not let their emo\\xadtions co\\xaderce them into plans which sate their emo\\xadtions while sac\\xadri\\xadfic\\xading their over\\xadall goals.One must be able to plan effec\\xadtively up and down the re\\xadcur\\xadsive tree of their plans: enu\\xadmer\\xadat\\xading, eval\\xadu\\xadat\\xading, and re\\xadduc\\xading un\\xadcer\\xadtainty wher\\xadever needed.Endnotes[1] This broad defi\\xadni\\xadtion stands in op\\xadpo\\xadsi\\xadtion to a com\\xadmon defi\\xadni\\xadtion which uses plan\\xadning pri\\xadmar\\xadily in con\\xadtexts of schedul\\xading, e.g. plan your day, plan your week. The broader defi\\xadni\\xadtion here is es\\xadsen\\xadtially syn\\xadony\\xadmous with de\\xadci\\xadsion-mak\\xading, per\\xadhaps differ\\xading only in con\\xadno\\xadta\\xadtion. De\\xadci\\xadsions some\\xadwhat im\\xadply a one-off choice be\\xadtween op\\xadtions whereas plan\\xadning im\\xadplies se\\xadlec\\xadtion of mul\\xadti\\xadple ac\\xadtions to be taken over time. The term plan\\xadning also some\\xadwhat more than de\\xadci\\xadsion-mak\\xading high\\xadlights that there is a goal one wishes to achieve.[2] I of\\xadten hear peo\\xadple faced with clear pri\\xadori\\xadti\\xadza\\xadtion tasks plead that they need more re\\xadsource, that re\\xadsource scarcity is the prob\\xadlem. Some\\xadtimes it is, some\\xadtimes the best ac\\xadtion is to get more re\\xadsources. But of\\xadten it is a fal\\xadlacy to think that if you can’t solve pri\\xadori\\xadti\\xadza\\xadtion now, it will some\\xadhow be eas\\xadier when you have more re\\xadsources. How\\xadever many re\\xadsources you have, they will be finite and you will still be able to think of things you’d like to do with even more re\\xadsources, things which feel just as nec\\xades\\xadsary. In short, you should get used to choos\\xading sooner rather than later. [3] To be tech\\xadni\\xadcal, un\\xadcer\\xadtainty re\\xadduc\\xadtion is about con\\xadcen\\xadtrat\\xading the prob\\xada\\xadbil\\xadity mass of your prior dis\\xadtri\\xadbu\\xadtion into nar\\xadrower bands.

As\\xadsume there are m po\\xadten\\xadtial pro\\xadjects. For now, as\\xadsume that the pro\\xadjects are in\\xadde\\xadpen\\xaddent; that is, it is rea\\xadson\\xadable to se\\xadlect any com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtion of pro\\xadjects and the cost and value of any pro\\xadject do not de\\xadpend on what other pro\\xadjects are se\\xadlected. Define, for each pro\\xadject i = 1, 2,..., m the zero-one vari\\xadable xi. The vari\\xadable xi is one if the pro\\xadject is ac\\xadcepted and zero if it is re\\xadjected. Let ci be the in\\xadcre\\xadmen\\xadtal value (b for “benefit”) of the i’th pro\\xadject and ci be its cost. Let C be the to\\xadtal available bud\\xadget. The goal is to se\\xadlect from the available pro\\xadjects the sub\\xadset of pro\\xadjects with a to\\xadtal cost less than or equal to C that pro\\xadduces the great\\xadest pos\\xadsi\\xadble to\\xadtal value.The prob\\xadlem may be ex\\xadpressed math\\xade\\xadmat\\xadi\\xadcally as:Max\\xadi\\xadmize m∑i=1bixiSub\\xadject to: m∑i=1cixi≤C and xi= 0 or 1 for i = 1, 2,...,m.This is a zero-one in\\xadte\\xadger op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem. It is NP-Com\\xadplete, i.e. the time re\\xadquired to solve such a prob\\xadlem us\\xading any cur\\xadrently known al\\xadgorithm in\\xadcreases rapidly as the size of the pro\\xadgram grows. Nat\\xadu\\xadrally, be\\xadcause al\\xadlo\\xadcat\\xading re\\xadsources/\\u200bplan\\xadning is in\\xadvolves com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtions of ac\\xadtions and com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadtions tend to ex\\xadplode. It can be okay if there the num\\xadber of pos\\xadsi\\xadble ac\\xadtions/\\u200bpro\\xadjects is rel\\xada\\xadtively small, but re\\xadmem\\xadber that even 10! is already 3.6 mil\\xadlion. The equa\\xadtion above isn’t com\\xadpre\\xadhen\\xadsive enough to cap\\xadture the full de\\xadtail of real-world plan\\xadning, but it should suffice to in\\xaddi\\xadcate that plan\\xadning is of\\xadten of the com\\xadbi\\xadna\\xadto\\xadri\\xadally ex\\xadplo\\xadsive class. (If you want to see how more fac\\xadtors can be in\\xadcluded, see the rest of Merkhofer’s pa\\xadper where he mod\\xadels mu\\xadtu\\xadally ex\\xadclu\\xadsive/\\u200bse\\xadquen\\xadtial pro\\xadjects, multi-pe\\xadriod plan\\xadning, and sen\\xadsi\\xadtivity to de\\xadlay of pro\\xadjects.)Note how\\xadever that this treat\\xadment as\\xadsumes that the benefits and costs are perfectly known when perform\\xading the op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion. In the real world, we only have dis\\xadtri\\xadbu\\xadtions over the benefits and costs. A true for\\xadmal\\xadism of real-world pri\\xadori\\xadti\\xadza\\xadtion would be couched in statis\\xadti\\xadcal terms. Plus, the benefits and costs in the above for\\xadmal\\xadism are scalars which can be added and com\\xadpared, e.g. dol\\xadlars. In the real world, the benefits and costs we weigh are of dis\\xadparate types which at best have vague con\\xadver\\xadsion rates be\\xadtween them. So you might imag\\xadine that a com\\xadpre\\xadhen\\xadsive for\\xadmal\\xadism would deal in vec\\xadtors and would in\\xadclude a com\\xadpli\\xadcated func\\xadtion for com\\xadpar\\xading those vec\\xadtors.The point here is not that we should at\\xadtempt to cre\\xadate or use math\\xade\\xadmat\\xadi\\xadcal mod\\xadels in our plan\\xadning, but to rec\\xadog\\xadnize that it is pre\\xadcisely this math which our brains must find some way of crunch\\xading. Un\\xadder\\xadstand\\xading that this is the im\\xadmense prob\\xadlem we are tasked with, we can start to look for ways to han\\xaddle it bet\\xadter than our de\\xadfault. And, you know, also give our\\xadselves a bit of break when we find plan\\xadning hard.What links here?Why Plan\\xadning is Hard: A Mul\\xadti\\xadfaceted Model\\n by Ruby (31 Mar 2019 2:33 UTC; 29 points)Rohin Shah 31 Mar 2019 22:08 UTC 6 pointsParentThis is a zero-one in\\xadte\\xadger op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem.

Of course, once you turn plan\\xadning into a multi-per\\xadson ac\\xadtivity, which I think any com\\xadpre\\xadhen\\xadsive model of plan\\xadning should treat it as, you also need to fac\\xadtor in un\\xadcer\\xadtainty about oth\\xaders’ plans, which com\\xadpli\\xadcates the model quite a bit.\\navturchin 31 Mar 2019 10:58 UTC 1 pointEach plan re\\xadal\\xadi\\xadsa\\xadtion con\\xadsists of sev\\xaderal stages, which are similar in very differ\\xadent types of tasks:1) Plan\\xadning and data gath\\xader\\xading about differ\\xadent tasks.2) Prepa\\xadra\\xadtion: buy\\xading in\\xadstru\\xadments, col\\xadlect\\xading data for this task, reg\\xadister on Tin\\xadder etc.3) Creat\\xading “first draft”.

Synchronous transmission is effective, dependable, and often utilised for transmitting a large amount of data.\\xa0 It offers real-time communication between linked devices. An example of synchronous transmission would be the transfer of a large text file.\\xa0 Before the file is transmitted, it is first dissected into blocks of sentences.\\xa0 The blocks are then transferred over the communication link to the target location. Because there are no beginning and end bits, the data transfer rate is quicker but there’s an increased possibility of errors occurring.\\xa0 Over time, the clocks will get out of sync, and the target device would have the incorrect time, so some bytes could become damaged on account of lost bits.\\xa0 To resolve this issue, it’s necessary to regularly re-synchronise the clocks, as well as to make use of check digits to ensure that the bytes are correctly received and translated.  Characteristics of Synchronous Transmission There are no spaces in between characters being sent.Timing is provided by modems or other devices at the end of the transmission.Special\\xa0’syn’\\xa0characters goes before the data being sent.The\\xa0syn\\xa0characters are included between chunks of data for timing functions. Examples of Synchronous Transmission ChatroomsVideo conferencingTelephonic conversationsFace-to-face interactions Asynchronous Transmission In asynchronous transmission, data moves in a half-paired approach, 1 byte or 1 character at a time.\\xa0 It sends the data in a constant current of bytes.\\xa0 The size of a character transmitted is 8 bits, with a parity bit added both at the beginning and at the end, making it a total of 10 bits.\\xa0 It doesn’t need a clock for integration—rather, it utilises the parity bits to tell the receiver how to translate the data. It is straightforward, quick, cost-effective, and doesn’t need 2-way communication to function. Characteristics of Asynchronous Transmission Each character is headed by a beginning bit and concluded with one or more end bits.There may be gaps or spaces in between characters.

Now, maybe\\nthere\\'s some magic technique for picking out the information that\\nmatters, passing over the rest, and writing out a single, coherent\\nstory in one pass through all the papers you can find. If that\\ntechnique exists, I have no idea what it is.\\nSo when every paper brings up ten new questions and twenty papers to\\nstart answering them, I need a system to keep my notes organized. I\\nneed notes that let me jump back and forth between papers without\\nlosing my place, draw links between papers, and store lists of\\ncitations to come back to. Here\\'s how I do it.\\n\\nStoring papers with Zotero\\nThe first tool I use is Zotero, a reference\\nmanager. Zotero\\'s job is to store all the actual papers I come across,\\nalong with information like data on how to cite the papers and any\\ntags they might have been published with. It can grab that information\\nfrom my web browser, whether from a journal\\'s website or someplace\\nlike Google Scholar or PubMed. It\\'s also great for quickly putting\\ntogether a bibliography, using bibtex or similar programs, when I want\\nto write up some results.\\n\\n\\n\\nZotero stores the papers I want to\\nread and reference. I scaled up the font size here to make it readable\\nin a tiny blog image.\\nZotero isn\\'t the only choice for reference managers.\\nMendeley is another popular choice, and\\nthere are a\\nwhole bunch more\\nout there. I picked Zotero arbitrarily a few years ago, but it\\'s\\nworking out well because of its emacs integration.\\nKeeping notes with Emacs and Org mode\\nYou see, Zotero has some note-taking functions, and I used to keep my\\nnotes there, but there were some problems. Notes are stored as\\nseparate files for each paper, but I want to cross-reference notes\\nfrom a lot of different papers at once. And while the editor has some\\nrich-text capabilities (e.g. bold and italic text), it\\'s missing\\nimportant things I need in my notes, like the ability to typeset\\nequations.\\nThat\\'s where Emacs and its\\nextension Org mode come in. To borrow a term\\nfrom Perl enthusiasts, Org mode is the swiss army chainsaw of text\\ndocument formats. Org mode documents have a lot of features, and it\\'s\\nway beyond this post\\'s scope to describe them all. For the purpose of\\nresearch notes, the most useful things it lets me do are:\\n\\nI can store my notes in a hierarchical tree structure, and I can\\n  hide parts of the tree from view in order to focus on other parts.\\nI can put hyperlinks into my notes, including links to papers,\\n  websites, or other parts of the file.\\nI can put math in my notes using Latex, and view the typeset\\n  equations right in my Emacs buffer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA sample from my notes file. You\\ncan see the tree structure of the file, some links to papers, and a\\nlittle bit of inline math, using Latex.\\nGluing it all together with zotxt\\nNow, see those links to papers in my notes buffer? I didn\\'t have to\\ncopy and paste them from anywhere. I inserted them with just three\\nkeystrokes each. So far, I\\'ve just described some useful pieces of\\nsoftware, but the interesting part of my workflow is how they fit\\ntogether.\\nzotxt is an extension that lets\\nother programs talk to Zotero, and Emacs has a package to talk to it.\\nIt\\'s even structured specifically to work with Org mode documents.\\nWith zotxt, my workflow looks like this:\\n\\nI find a paper I want to look at somewhere on the internet.\\nI use Zotero\\'s browser plugin to save it to Zotero. Hopefully it\\n  grabs the paper itself and this happens in one click; if the site\\n  doesn\\'t play along, I spend a minute grabbing a pdf and feeding it\\n  to Zotero.\\nI insert a link to the Zotero entry into my notes file in Emacs. I\\n  can do this with the key chords C-c \" \". I don\\'t need to further\\n  specify what paper I want to grab: the browser plugin leaves the\\n  paper selected in Zotero, and zotxt can grab the selected paper.\\nWhen I want to read the paper, I go to the link and tell Emacs to\\n  open the paper in my system PDF viewer. The key chords for this are\\n  C-c \" a, and then selecting the PDF attachment from the Helm\\n  window that appears (usually I just type pdf RET).\\nWhen I\\'m reading a paper and see a citation that might be useful, I\\n  look it up on the internet and repeat this process to store a note\\n  linking to it.\\n\\nIt took me a while to get it set up to my liking, so here\\'s how I did\\nit:\\n\\nFirst, install zotxt. If you\\'re\\n  using Zotero as a firefox extension, you just need to install zotxt\\n  as another extension. If you\\'re using the standalone Zotero client,\\n  you can still do it: download the extension file from that link,\\n  then go to the Add-Ons Manager under the Tools menu and find the\\n  option to install an add-on from a file.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe menu option looks like\\nthis.\\n\\nNext, install the zotxt package in emacs. If your\\n  package manager is set up, you\\n  can just type M-x package-install RET zotxt RET.\\nNow, when org-zotxt-mode is active, you can use its functions in\\n  your org-mode buffers. You can search for papers and insert them\\n  with C-c \" i, insert the currently-selected paper in Zotero with\\n  C-u C-c \" i, and open a paper\\'s PDF or other related files by\\n  moving the cursor to a link and typing C-c \" a. However, you might\\n  want a little bit more setup to deal with some annoyances.\\nYou probably want to have org-zotxt-mode automatically activated\\n  in all your org-mode documents. To make that happen, you can add\\n  some code to your .emacs file to start up this mode on all your\\n  org-mode buffers - see below this list for the .emacs\\n  configuration I use.\\nIf you want to insert a link to the currently-selected item a lot,\\n  C-u C-c \" i is an awkward sequence to type. I rebound it to C-c \"\\n  \".\\nYou might notice that when you insert a link to a paper, the text of\\n  that link is a full citation. That might be what you want, but I\\n  just want the authors, paper name, and year. It took me a bit of\\n  hacking to get around that: it\\'s possible to tell the emacs zotxt\\n  interface to use a different citation format than the default, but I\\n  had to throw together a little XML file to give it a shorter format\\n  than a full citation. (This may not be the easiest or cleanest way\\n  to do it, but it works!)\\n  That XML file is here. To use it, go into\\n  your Zotero preferences and select Cite -> Styles, and add the file.\\n  It should appear in the menu as \"mkbehr\\'s short reference format\".\\n  Then add the last two lines in the .emacs snippet below, and you\\n  should get shorter citations.\\nYou probably want to install the\\n  Helm package, to make zotxt\\'s\\n  search interface easier to navigate. That link should tell you\\n  everything you need to know.\\n\\nHere\\'s that .emacs setup code:\\n;; Activate org-zotxt-mode in org-mode buffers\\n(add-hook \\'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-zotxt-mode 1)))\\n;; Bind something to replace the awkward C-u C-c \" i\\n(define-key org-mode-map\\n  (kbd \"C-c \\\\\" \\\\\"\") (lambda () (interactive)\\n                      (org-zotxt-insert-reference-link \\'(4))))\\n;; Change citation format to be less cumbersome in files.\\n;; You\\'ll need to install mkbehr-short into your style manager first.\\n(eval-after-load \"zotxt\"\\n\\'(setq zotxt-default-bibliography-style \"mkbehr-short\"))\\n\\nOf course, I\\'m not done tinkering to make my workflow better. I hear\\ngood things about the org-ref\\nand helm-bibtex\\npackages - if only I can keep an up-to-date bibtex file as I add papers\\nto my library, I can associate links with not only a paper\\'s pdf, but\\nalso that paper\\'s section of my notes file. And I haven\\'t found a\\nsmooth way to take a paper and pull up the papers it cites in my\\nbrowser. But until then, I\\'m pretty happy with this setup.\\nHappy researching!\\n\\n\\n\\nemacs\\nresearch\\n\\n\\n\\nPrevious post\\n\\n\\nNext post\\n\\nComments\\n\\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\\n\\nComments powered by Disqus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Contents © 2015         Michael Behr - Powered by         Nikola\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

But as phrased, I think this particular formulation when not paired with any caveats creates just a little more panic than is warranted.\\nBefore I go further, Ioannidis’ evidence:\\nHe starts with simple statistics. Most studies are judged to have “discovered” a result if they reach p < 0.05, that is, if there is 5% probability or less the findings are due to mere chance (this is the best case scenario, where the study is totally free from bias or methodological flaws).\\nSuppose you throw a dart at the Big Chart O’ Human Metabolic Pathways and supplement your experimental group with the chemical you hit. Then ten years later you come back and see how many of them died of heart attacks.\\nMost chemicals on the Big Chart probably don’t prevent heart attacks. Let’s say only one in a thousand do. Maybe your study will successfully find that 1/1000. But the 999 inactive chemicals will also throw up about 50 (999 * 5%) false positives significant at the 5% level. Therefore, even if you conduct your study perfectly, and it shows a significant decrease in heart attacks, there’s about a 98% chance it’s false.\\nOne would hope medical scientists plan their studies with a little more care than throwing a dart at a metabolic chart. Yet many don’t; a lot of genetic research is conducted by checking every single gene against the characteristic of interest and seeing if any stick. And even when scientists have well-thought out theories, the inherent difficulty of medicine means they probably have less than a 50-50 chance of being right the first time, which means a 5% significance level has a less than 5% predictive value.\\nAnd this isn’t even counting publication bias or poor methodology or conflicts of interest or anything like that.\\nDisturbingly, this problem seems to be borne out in empirical tests. Amgen Pharmaceuticals says it repeated experiments in 53 important papers and was only able to confirm 6. And Ioannidis himself did a re-analysis which is quoted as finding that “41% of the most influential studies in medicine have been convincingly shown to be wrong or significantly exaggerated.”\\nSo I don’t at all disagree with the general consensus that this is a huge problem. But I do disagree with the following statements:\\n1. 90% of all medical research is wrong\\n2. A given study you read, or your doctor reads, is 90% likely to be wrong.\\n3. 90% of the things doctors believe, presumably based on these medical findings, is wrong.\\n4. This proves the medical establishment is clueless and hopelessly irrational and that two smart people working in a basement for five minutes can discover a new medical science far better than what all doctors could have produced in seventy years.\\nIs 90% of all medical research wrong?\\nAs far as I can tell, there is no source at all for the 90% figure. I can’t find it in any of Ioannidis’ studies and indeed they contradict it. His table of predictive values of different studies doesn’t have any entries that correspond to 90% (“underpowered exploratory epidemiological study” is relatively close with 88%, but this is just for that one type of study, which is known to be especially bad). The Atlantic sums it up as:\\nHis model predicted, in different fields of medical research, rates of wrongness roughly corresponding to the observed rates at which findings were later convincingly refuted: 80 percent of non-randomized studies (by far the most common type) turn out to be wrong, as do 25 percent of supposedly gold-standard randomized trials, and as much as 10 percent of the platinum-standard large randomized trials.\\nNotice which number is conspicuously missing from that excerpt.\\nNow another study of his did show that in 90% of studies with very large effect sizes, later research eventually found the effect size to be smaller, but this was out of a pool of studies specifically selected for being surprising and likely to be false. I don’t think it’s the source of the number and if it were that would be terrible.\\nAs far as I can tell, this started from a quote in an Atlantic article on Ioannidis which included the line “he charges that as much as 90 percent of the published medical information that doctors rely on is flawed”. This then got turned into the title of a Time article “A Researcher’s Claim: 90% of Medical Research Is Wrong”, which itself got perverted to 90% of Medical Research Is Completely False.\\nSo an unsourced quote that up to 90% of studies are flawed has somehow turned into a rallying cry that it has been proven that at least 90% of studies are false. To take this seriously we would have to believe that the numbers for all research are the same as the numbers for the poorly conducted epidemiological studies or the studies specifically selected for surprising results. I guess having a nice round number is good insofar as it makes the public pay attention to this field, but as far as actual numbers go, it’s kind of made up.\\nIs any given study you read, or your doctor reads, 90% likely to be wrong?\\nBut let’s take the above number at face value and say that 90% of medical studies are wrong. Fine. Does that mean the last medical study you read about in Scientific American, or that your doctor used to recommend you a new drug, is wrong?\\nNo. Let’s look at the Medical Evidence Pyramid.\\nThe medical evidence pyramid is much like all pyramids, in that the bottom levels are infested with snakes and booby traps and vengeful medical evidence mummies. It’s only after you reach the top few levels that you get the gold and jewels and precious, precious mummy powder.\\nThis plays out in the same table of Ioannidis’ speculations we saw before. While an in vitro study of the type used to identify possible drug targets might have a positive predictive value of 0.1%, a good meta-analysis or great RCT has a positive predictive value of 85%; that is, it’s 85% likely to be true.\\nThere are only two reasons someone might hear about the studies on the snake-infested bottom levels of the pyramid. Number one, that person is a specialist in the field who is valiantly trying to read through the entire niche medical journal the paper was published in. Or number two, the study found something incredible like DONUTS CURE CANCER IN A SAMPLE OF THREE LAB RATS!!! and the media decided to pick up on it. Hopefully everyone already ignores studies of the DONUTS CURE CANCER IN A SAMPLE OF THREE LAB RATES!!! type studies; if not, there’s really not much I can say to you.\\nBut most of the medical results that you hear about are the ones that get published in important journals and are trumpeted far and wide as important medical results. These are closer to the top of the pyramid than to the bottom. They’re usually big expensive studies on thousands of people. Since the universities, hospitals, and corporations sponsoring them aren’t idiots, they usually hire a decent statistician or two to make sure that they don’t spend $300,000 testing something only to have a letter to the editor of the NEJM point out that they forgot to blind their subjects so it’s totally worthless. And finally, in many cases you would only run a study that big and expensive if you had something plausible to test – you’re not going to spend $300,000 just to throw a dart at the Big Chart O’ Human Metabolic Pathways and see what happens.\\nSo these studies that people actually hear about are bigger, they have more incentives to get their methodology right, and they’re testing propositions with high plausibility. How do they do?\\nI said above that one of Ioannidis’ studies was frequently quoted as saying that “41% of the most influential studies in medicine have been convincingly shown to be wrong or significantly exaggerated.”\\nThis is from a great study I totally endorse, but the 41% number was maximized for scariness. If I wanted to bias my reporting the other direction, I could equally well report the same results as “Only about 5% of influential medical experiments with adequate sample size have later been contradicted.”\\nHow? Ioannidis got his result by taking all medical studies with over 1000 citations in the ’90s, of which there were 49. Of these, 4 were negative results (ie “X doesn’t work”) so he threw them out. This is the first part I think is kind of unfair. Yes, negative results aren’t as sexy as positive results, but they’re still influential medical research, and if Ioannidis is quoted as saying that X% of medical findings are later contradicted when he means that X% of positive medical findings are, that’s not quite fair.\\nAnnnnyway, of the 45 famous studies with positive findings, 11 didn’t really get tested and so we don’t know if they’re right or wrong. Eliminating these is also a potential bias, because we expect that studies which seem sketchy are more likely to be replicated so people can find out if they’re actually right. Ioannidis quite rightly set himself a higher bar by not eliminating them, but the quote about 41% of studies being wrong does seem to have gone back eliminated them – at least that’s the only way I can make the study numbers add up to 41% (the numbers given in the study actually say 32% of these studies failed to replicate).\\nSo our 41% number is based off of 34 studies, best described as “34 famous medical studies that found positive findings ie the least believable kind of finding, plus were suspicious enough that someone wanted to replicate them”.\\nOf these 34 studies, 7 were outright contradicted. Bad? Definitely. But for example, one of them was a study with a sample size of nine patients. Another study may well have been correct, but the results were interpreted wrongly (it said that estrogen decreased lipoprotein levels which everyone assumed meant decreased heart disease, but in fact later studies found increased heart disease without necessarily disproving the lipoprotein levels). Five of the six others were epidemiological trials, firmly on the middle of the pyramid. Only two of these contradicted studies were a true experiment with a sample size of >10.\\n(even here, I am sort of skeptical. Three of these disproven studies, two epidemiologicals and an experimental, purported to show Vitamin E decreased heart disease. Then a single better trial showed that Vitamin E did not decrease heart disease. While recognizing the last trial was better, it does seem like something more complicated is going on here than “all three of the earlier trials were just wrong”, and I’ve recently been convinced antioxidant research is a huge minefield where tiny differences in protocol can cause big differences in results. But fine, let’s grant this one and say there were two outright-contradicted experiments.)\\nSo aside from the seven that were outright wrong, another seven were listed as “overstating their results”.\\nThere are a couple of problems that bothered me here. One of them was that Ioannidis decided to count studies as contradicting each other if relative risk in one study was half or less than in the other study, “regardless of whether confidence intervals might overlap or not”. So even if a study effectively said “Here is a wide range of possible results, we think it’s about here in the middle but our research is consistent with it being anywhere in this range”, if another study got somewhere else in that range, the first study was marked as “exaggerated”.\\nThe second problem is, once again, poor studies versus poor interpretations. Ioannidis cites as an example of an exaggerated study one lasting a year and showing that the drug zidovudine helped slow the progression of HIV to AIDS. It concluded that giving HIV patients long-term zidovudine was probably a good idea. A later study lasted longer, and said that yes, zidovudine worked for a year, but then it stopped working. Because the earlier study had suggested longer-term zidovudine, it was marked as “exaggerated results”, even though the results of both studies were totally consistent with one another (both found that zidovudine worked for the first year). This is probably of little consolation to AIDS patients who were treated with a useless drug, but it seems pretty important if we’re investigating study methodology.\\nSo the way I got my 5% figure was to take the two experimental studies with decent sample sizes which were actually contradicted and compare them to the 38 large experimental studies total that started the experiment.\\nSo this suggests that if you see a large experimental study being trumpeted in the medical literature, the chance that it will be found to be totally false (as opposed to true but exaggerated) within ten years or so is only about 5% – which if you understand p-values is about what you should have believed already.\\n(I think. This requires quite a few assumptions, not the least of which is that my calculations above are correct!)\\nAlso worth noting: Ioannidis’ experiment did not investigate the absolute highest level of the medical pyramid, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. I expect the best of these to be better than any individual study.\\n3. Are 90% of the things doctors believe, presumably based on medical findings, wrong?\\nAfter going through the steps above, it should be pretty obvious that the answer is no, because doctors are mostly reading famous influential studies like the ones mentioned above, which are at worst 40% and at best 5% wrong.\\nBut there’s another factor to be taken into account, which is that why would you only read one study on something when lots of important findings have been investigated multiple times?\\nSuppose that you’re throwing darts at the Big Chart O’ Human Metabolic Pathways, with your 1/1000 base rate of true hypotheses. You run a very good methodologically sound study and find p = .05. But now there’s still only a 1/50 chance your hypothesis is correct.\\nBut another team in China runs the same study, and they also find p = .05. We expect the Chinese to get false to true results at a rate of one to two (because the 1 in the 1/50 stays 1, but the 50 is divided by 20 to produce approximately 2. Wow, I’m even worse at explaining math than I am at doing it.)\\nNow a team in, oh, let’s say Turkey runs the same study, and they also find p = .05. We expect the Turks to get false to true results at a rate of one to ten, for, uh, the same math reasons as the Chinese. When the, um, Icelanders repeat the study, our odds go to one to two hundred.\\nSo we started with 1000:1 odds, the first study brought us up to 50:1 odds, the second study to 2:1 odds, the third study to 1:10 odds, and the fourth study to 1:200 odds, ie we are now 99.5% sure we’re right.\\nReal medicine is both better and worse than this. It’s better in that we often have dozens of studies rather than just four. It’s worse in that the studies are not all so methodologically sound that we can multiply our odds by 20 each time (to put it lightly).\\nBut some of them are, and once we get enough of them, the base rate problems which plague individual medical findings go away very quickly. Even if only one of the studies is methodologically sound, if the reason they’re studying their topic is because a bunch of other less believable studies all got positive results, that’s a much better base rate than “because I hit it with my dart”.\\nWhen doctors say that, for example, iron supplements help anaemia, it’s not because they hit iron on their Big Chart O’ Human Metabolic Pathways, then ran a single study, got p = .05, and rushed off to publish a medical textbook. It’s because they knew hemoglobin had iron in it, there are at least 21 randomized controlled studies, probably some had p-values closer to .001 than to .05 even though I don’t have any of them in front of me to check, and eventually some really really smart statisticians at the Cochrane Collaboration gave it their seal of approval. Most doctors’ beliefs aren’t on quite this high a level, but most doctors’ beliefs aren’t on the “Someone threw a dart, then did one study” level either.\\n4. Does this prove the medical establishment is clueless and hopelessly irrational and that two smart people working in a basement for five minutes can discover a new medical science far better than what all doctors could have produced in seventy years?\\nA lot of people seem to go from Ioannidis’ experiment to something like “So I guess everyone in medicine is just clueless about how science and statistics work. I’ll go read a couple of medical studies and then be able to outperform everyone in this totally flawed field.”\\n(important note: I’m not accusing MetaMed of this! They seem pretty sane. I am accusing some people I come across in the community who are much more enthusiastic than the relatively sober MetaMed people of doing something like this.)\\nBut the problem isn’t that no one in medicine is familiar with Ioannidis’ research. It’s that they’re not really sure what to do about it and figuring out a plan and implementing it will take time and effort.\\nIoannidis’ work isn’t exactly secret. I’ve hung out with groups of residents (ie trainee doctors) who have discussed Ioannidis’ findings over the dinner table. According to The Atlantic\\nTo say that Ioannidis’s work has been embraced would be an understatement. His PLoS Medicine paper is the most downloaded in the journal’s history, and it’s not even Ioannidis’s most-cited work—that would be a paper he published in Nature Genetics on the problems with gene-link studies. Other researchers are eager to work with him: he has published papers with 1,328 different co-authors at 538 institutions in 43 countries, he says. Last year he received, by his estimate, invitations to speak at 1,000 conferences and institutions around the world, and he was accepting an average of about five invitations a month until a case last year of excessive-travel-induced vertigo led him to cut back.\\nSo if so many people are aware of this, why isn’t the problem getting fixed more quickly?\\nAn optimist could say the problem isn’t getting fixed because there is no problem. A vast volume of embarassingly wrong medical literature gets published, inflates the publishers’ resumes, and everyone else ignores it and concentrates on the not-really-so-bad large randomized trials. To the post-cynic it is all a smooth, well-functioning machine.\\nA pessimist might say that the problem isn’t getting fixed because it’s impossible. The average medical hypothesis is always going to have a low base rate of being true – in fact, if we force scientists to only study high base-rate hypotheses, by definition everything we discover will be boring. There will never be enough resources to apply huge rigorous trials to every one of the millions of things worth studying. So we’re always going to have weak studies about low-base rate hypotheses, which is what Ioannidis is attacking as the recipe for failure.\\nA realist might point out there are some things we can do, but it involves coordinating a huge and complicated system with many moving parts. Journals can force trials to register before they conduct their experiments to avoid publication bias. The scientific community can give more status to people who perform important replications and especially important negative replications. Study authors and the media can come up with better ways to report their results to doctors and the public without blowing them out of proportion. Statisticians can…actually, anything I say statisticians can do is just going to be a mysterious answer, along the lines of “do better statistics stuff”, so I’m not going to embarass myself by completing this sentence except to postulate that I’ll bet there’s some recommendation that could complete it usefully.\\nBut all these things involve vague entities who aren’t really actors (“the scientific community”, “the media”) acting in ways that are kind of against their immediate incentives. This is hard to make people do and usually involves a lot of grassroots coordination effort. Which is going on. But it takes time.\\nBut no matter what happens, I think a useful epistemic habit is to be very skeptical of individual studies, and skeptical but not too skeptical of large randomized trials, good meta-analyses, and general medical consensus when supported by an evidence base.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.

I, for one, don’t go around claiming that 90% of research studies are false; I believe Ioannides only found a little more than half of medical studies were disconfirmed by later experiments.  90% of all *pre-clinical cancer studies* are later disconfirmed, which does mean that if you see a study that says “X cures cancer” but X hasn’t made it to clinical trials yet, X probably *doesn’t* cure cancer.\\n2.  I don’t expect most things doctors believe to be wrong.  I don’t even expect most things *people* believe to be wrong; after all, most things people believe are of the form “water is wet,” so uncontroversial that we barely notice them as beliefs.  What I *do* expect to be wrong are beliefs that aren’t based on a model of the world.  \\n“Iron supplements cure anemia” is a belief that depends on knowing how hemoglobin works, knowing how digestion works, having observed iron supplements cure anemia…lots of different kinds of evidence, at different scales of complexity, confirm the prediction. \\n“Antioxidants reduce cancer risk” is an example of the kind of belief we should be skeptical about.  Free radical damage may lead to cancer; antioxidants stabilize free radicals; so one might think antioxidants prevent cancer. Some early clinical trials found that taking antioxidants reduced cancer risk; but further study found that they probably don’t.  And there’s some evidence that “free radicals” (or reactive oxygen species) are the mechanism by which the immune system and chemotherapy drugs attack cancers, so antioxidants, if anything, protect cancer cells.  We don’t have a clear model of what antioxidants do, in the same way that we have a clear model of what role iron plays in the blood, so we ought to be skeptical of any conclusions about “antioxidants are good for you” or “antioxidants are bad for you.” And we ought to be *especially* skeptical of anything that assumes a cause (eating antioxidants) will result in a health outcome (less cancer) merely because the cause affects an intermediate biochemical step (stabilizing free radicals).\\nIf there’s a prevailing theory in the biomedical sciences that a.) relies on complex chains of genetic and biochemical causation, and b.) hasn’t shown measurable results in the form of lower death rates, then I’m going to tag it as improbable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Scott Alexander says: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tFebruary 17, 2013 at 8:31 pm \\n1. I didn’t mean to “accuse” you of saying this. I meant other, less reputable sources like Time Magazine and most of the rest of the media.\\n2. I’m not sure to what degree I agree with your emphasis on understanding mechanism. There are a lot of things that work in biology without us having any idea how. Natural selection was a pretty good example until we discovered genes. Another good example would be digitalis, which was used to treat heart failure since the 1700s but whose full mechanism of action was only discovered in the last few decades. I prefer good experimental results to good theoretical explanation, but the caveat which I think you’re trying to point out is that they had better be *good* experimental results, as opposed to marginal experimental results.\\n3. The last part wasn’t meant as an attack on MetaMed, just on some of the people who try to talk about this on Less Wrong. I’ve edited the post to try to make this slightly clearer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Sarah says: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tFebruary 17, 2013 at 8:15 pm \\nA defense of MetaMed:\\n1.  We are not a Silicon Valley startup, we aren’t even based in Silicon Valley, we don’t belong to that culture, we’re not a consumer web app, there’s really no sense in which that’s the right reference class.\\n2.  We are only doing a major publicity launch at the end of this *month*, so name changes are not really a practical issue.  The name changes were in response to market research — people are bad at intuiting what kinds of names appeal to customers, and we finally settled on MetaMed after our marketing team put a lot of effort into finding out what made the best impression. It’s just window dressing; the internal structure of the company has stayed the same.\\n3.  It’s useless to promise we can fix a hard problem until we succeed in fixing it.  But we’re not claiming to be able to waltz in and fix medicine with no effort.  One of the main things we’re doing is a bit more modest: just *assembling* a coherent model out of the research that already exists.  \\nWe know, for example, that statistical prediction rules work very well for medical diagnosis and risk prediction; these are just simple little combinations of a few known risk factors for, say, heart attacks, that give each patient a score rating their hart attack risk.  But these rules only exist for a few special cases in medicine.  For most diseases, nobody has gone around combining all the risk factors and all the signs and symptoms into a single statistical model that says “if we know X, Y, and Z about you, here’s how likely you are to have disease A.” \\nOne way of looking at MetaMed’s job is that we combine, reorganize, and quantify the existing scientific literature.  \\nNow, in a sense, you could say that medical culture already does this; doctors pretty much know, from some combination of their clinical experience, their med school education, and whatever research they have time to read, how to diagnose diseases and choose treatments.  But this is, one has to admit, an imperfect process.  Human minds are very bad at intuitively putting disparate pieces of information together.  That’s *why* things like checklists and statistical prediction rules can outperform clinicians; using intuitive judgment, you’ll forget things.  Formally organizing the research literature into prediction models is a kind of safeguard on expert judgment, and I think it’s quite likely to catch things doctors miss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Deiseach says: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 1:53 am \\n(1) Statistics are much more complicated than people (even smart, educated, knowledgeable in their field people) think.\\n(2) Medicine is an art more than a science.\\n(3) Confusion reigns.  For family reasons, I’ve been scouring online resources for information on diabetes diets, and I’m getting confusing recommendations even on the very same website; e.g. carbohydrates increase blood sugar – well and good; starch as well as sugar needs to be watched – fine, tell me more; eat vegetables rather than fruit – okay, what vegetables; eat carrots, they’re low-GI – no, don’t eat carrots, they’re loaded with sugar! Eat peas – no, don’t eat peas, they’re full of starch and starch is bad!\\nThe conclusion I am left with is that the only safe diet (for anything) is rainwater and moss 🙁\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Michael vassar says: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 10:06 am \\nThis is exactly what MetaMed is for.   It’s definitely the case that 1, 2, and 3 are true, but 1 is largely a consequence of accepting too low a standard when seeing people as smatt and knowledgeable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Sniffnoy says: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 2:22 am \\nSo this suggests that if you see a large experimental study being trumpeted in the medical literature, the chance that it will be found to be totally false (as opposed to true but exaggerated) within ten years or so is only about 5% – which if you understand p-values is about what you should have believed already.\\n(I think. This requires quite a few assumptions, not the least of which is that my calculations above are correct!)\\nNot really.  P-values are not how likely something is to be wrong or invalid.  Rather, they’re how likely this data was to show up if you were wrong, i.e., they’re P(E | not H) rather than P(not H | E).  (Except they’re not really that, either — they’re just how likely this data was to show up if you were wrong in a particular way, i.e. the null hypothesis.)\\nAnd yes this is very counterintuitive and hence why everybody gets them wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Scott Alexander says: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 1:03 pm \\nThe 5% number comes not from p-values but from the empirical observation that of 40 studies analyzed, 2 were wrong. This matches the number of studies that would be wrong merely by chance if we only took the p-value into account rather than the base rate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Sniffnoy says: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tFebruary 19, 2013 at 5:58 am \\nYes, but you say that the empirical 5% matches what you’d expect from a p-value of 5%, and I don’t think that’s correct.  Unless you just mean “hey look these numbers are the same!” which doesn’t really mean anything by itself.\\nI mean, you talk about just taking the p-value into account rather than the base rate, but it’s not at all clear to me that the way you do so is meaningful.  Just considering the equation P(H|E)=P(E|H)*P(H)/P(E), you’re suggesting that we “don’t take into account base rate” by assuming P(H)/P(E) is about 1?  I really don’t see what makes such an assumption reasonable.\\nNow if you want to say, “Let’s not worry about what P(H) is, and so just assume P(H)/P(E) is some constant”, that might make more sense.  But then you can’t get any particular number out of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Elissa says: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tFebruary 18, 2013 at 3:59 am \\nThanks for looking into the 90% thing.

I still think “80% of non-experimental studies” is a pretty big caveat compared to “80% of research” but I have no idea how this was phrased and for all I know you said it that way.

This is the first part I think is kind of unfair.\\nI disagree. Negative results don’t show that an effect isn’t there. They just show that it’s too small to see with that sample size. A negative result being later disproven does not show a flaw in the original study.\\nIf you show that the effect is there and is large enough that the first study shouldn’t have missed it, that’s a problem, but it makes this way more complicated so it’s easier just to ignore those studies.\\nThinking about this more, I guess they’d have to do something like this either way, to show that the study didn’t just fail to replicate because the second study had a false negative. Either they’d have to look at ones where the study where it fails is much more powerful, or they’d have to use a two-tailed T-test and show that the two studies shouldn’t result from the same effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPingback: The Problem With Connection Theory | The Rationalist Conspiracy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Q says: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tApril 28, 2014 at 4:10 pm \\nHere is a 90% number: “He (Ioannidis) charges that as much as 90 percent of the published medical information that doctors rely on is flawed.”\\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical-science/308269/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeta\\n\\nRegister Log in\\nEntries feed\\nComments feed\\nWordPress.org\\n\\n\\nB4X is a free and open source developer tool that allows users to write apps for Android, iOS, and more.\\n80,000 Hours researches different problems and professions to help you figure out how to do as much good as possible.

What is the re\\xadla\\xadtion\\xadship be\\xadtween a com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtional op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion pro\\xadcess — say, a com\\xadputer pro\\xadgram solv\\xading an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem — and a phys\\xadi\\xadcal op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion pro\\xadcess — say, a team of hu\\xadmans build\\xading a house?\\nWe pro\\xadpose the con\\xadcept of an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem as a phys\\xadi\\xadcally closed sys\\xadtem con\\xadtain\\xading both that which is be\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmized and that which is do\\xading the op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading, and defined by a ten\\xaddency to evolve from a broad basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion to\\xadwards a small set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to the sys\\xadtem. We com\\xadpare our defi\\xadni\\xadtion to that pro\\xadposed by Yud\\xadkowsky, and place our work in the con\\xadtext of work by Dem\\xadski and Garrabrant’s Embed\\xadded Agency, and Drexler’s Com\\xadpre\\xadhen\\xadsive AI Ser\\xadvices. We show that our defi\\xadni\\xadtion re\\xadsolves difficult cases pro\\xadposed by Daniel Filan. We work through nu\\xadmer\\xadous ex\\xadam\\xadples of biolog\\xadi\\xadcal, com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtional, and sim\\xadple phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems show\\xading how our defi\\xadni\\xadtion re\\xadlates to each.\\nIntroduction\\nIn the field of com\\xadputer sci\\xadence, an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion al\\xadgorithm is a com\\xadputer pro\\xadgram that out\\xadputs the solu\\xadtion, or an ap\\xadprox\\xadi\\xadma\\xadtion thereof, to an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem. An op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem con\\xadsists of an ob\\xadjec\\xadtive func\\xadtion to be max\\xadi\\xadmized or min\\xadi\\xadmized, and a fea\\xadsi\\xadble re\\xadgion within which to search for a solu\\xadtion. For ex\\xadam\\xadple we might take the ob\\xadjec\\xadtive func\\xadtion (x2−2)2 as a min\\xadi\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem and the whole real num\\xadber line as the fea\\xadsi\\xadble re\\xadgion. The solu\\xadtion then would be x=√2 and a work\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion al\\xadgorithm for this prob\\xadlem is one that out\\xadputs a close ap\\xadprox\\xadi\\xadma\\xadtion to this value.\\nIn the field of op\\xader\\xada\\xadtions re\\xadsearch and en\\xadg\\xadineer\\xading more broadly, op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion in\\xadvolves im\\xadprov\\xading some pro\\xadcess or phys\\xadi\\xadcal ar\\xadti\\xadfact so that it is fit for a cer\\xadtain pur\\xadpose or fulfills some set of re\\xadquire\\xadments. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, we might choose to mea\\xadsure a nail fac\\xadtory by the rate at which it out\\xadputs nails, rel\\xada\\xadtive to the cost of pro\\xadduc\\xadtion in\\xadputs. We can view this as a kind of ob\\xadjec\\xadtive func\\xadtion, with the fac\\xadtory as the ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion just as the vari\\xadable x was the ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion in the pre\\xadvi\\xadous ex\\xadam\\xadple.\\nThere is clearly a con\\xadnec\\xadtion be\\xadtween op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading the fac\\xadtory and op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for x, but what ex\\xadactly is this con\\xadnec\\xadtion? What is it that iden\\xadti\\xadfies an al\\xadgorithm as an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion al\\xadgorithm? What is it that iden\\xadti\\xadfies a pro\\xadcess as an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion pro\\xadcess?\\nThe an\\xadswer pro\\xadposed in this es\\xadsay is: an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem is a phys\\xadi\\xadcal pro\\xadcess in which the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion of some part of the uni\\xadverse moves pre\\xaddictably to\\xadwards a small set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions from any point in a broad basin of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions dur\\xading the op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion pro\\xadcess.\\nWe do not imag\\xadine that there is some en\\xadg\\xadine or agent or mind perform\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, sep\\xada\\xadrately from that which is be\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmized. We con\\xadsider the whole sys\\xadtem jointly — en\\xadg\\xadine and ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion — and ask whether it ex\\xadhibits a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards a pre\\xaddictable tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion. If so, then we call it an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem. If the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion is deep and wide then we say that this is a ro\\xadbust op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem.\\nAn op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem as defined in this es\\xadsay is known in dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems the\\xadory as a dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem with one or more at\\xadtrac\\xadtors. In this es\\xadsay we show how this frame\\xadwork can help to un\\xadder\\xadstand op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion as man\\xadi\\xadfested in phys\\xadi\\xadcally closed sys\\xadtems con\\xadtain\\xading both en\\xadg\\xadine and ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion.\\nIn this way we find that op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems are not some\\xadthing that are de\\xadsigned but are dis\\xadcov\\xadered. The con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space of the world con\\xadtains countless pock\\xadets shaped like small and large bas\\xadins, such that if the world should crest the rim of one of these pock\\xadets then it will nat\\xadu\\xadrally evolve to\\xadwards the bot\\xadtom of the basin. We care about them be\\xadcause we can use our own agency to tip the world into such a basin and then let go, know\\xading that from here on things will evolve to\\xadwards the tar\\xadget re\\xadgion.\\nAll op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion bas\\xadins have a finite ex\\xadtent. A ball may roll to the cen\\xadter of a valley if ini\\xadtially placed any\\xadwhere within the valley, but if it is placed out\\xadside the valley then it will roll some\\xadwhere else en\\xadtirely, or per\\xadhaps will not roll at all. Similarly, even a very ro\\xadbust op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem has an outer rim to its basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, such that if the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion of the sys\\xadtem is per\\xadturbed be\\xadyond that rim then the sys\\xadtem no longer evolves to\\xadwards the tar\\xadget that it once did. When an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem de\\xadvi\\xadates be\\xadyond its own rim, we say that it dies. An ex\\xadis\\xadten\\xadtial catas\\xadtro\\xadphe is when the op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem of life on Earth moves be\\xadyond its own outer rim.\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: com\\xadput\\xading the square root of two\\nSay I ask my com\\xadputer to com\\xadpute the square root of two, for ex\\xadam\\xadple by open\\xading a python in\\xadter\\xadpreter and typ\\xading:\\n>>> print(math.sqrt(2))\\n1.41421356237\\n\\nThe value printed here is ac\\xadtu\\xadally calcu\\xadlated by solv\\xading an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem. It works roughly as fol\\xadlows. First we set up an ob\\xadjec\\xadtive func\\xadtion that has as its min\\xadi\\xadmum value the square root of two. One func\\xadtion we could use is y=(x2−2)2\\n\\nNext we pick an ini\\xadtial es\\xadti\\xadmate for the square root of two, which can be any num\\xadber what\\xadso\\xadever. Let’s take 1.0 as our ini\\xadtial guess. Then we take a gra\\xaddi\\xadent step in the di\\xadrec\\xadtion in\\xaddi\\xadcated by com\\xadput\\xading the slope of the ob\\xadjec\\xadtive func\\xadtion at our ini\\xadtial es\\xadti\\xadmate:\\n\\nThen we re\\xadpeat this pro\\xadcess of com\\xadput\\xading the slope and up\\xaddat\\xading our es\\xadti\\xadmate over and over, and our op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion al\\xadgorithm quickly con\\xadverges to the square root of two:\\n\\nThis is gra\\xaddi\\xadent de\\xadscent, and it can be im\\xadple\\xadmented in a few lines of python code:\\n\\tcurrent_estimate = 1.0\\n\\tstep_size = 1e-3\\n\\twhile True:\\n\\t\\tobjective = (current_estimate**2 - 2) ** 2\\n\\t\\tgradient = 4 * current_estimate * (current_estimate**2 - 2)\\n\\t\\tif abs(gradient) < 1e-8:\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\tcurrent_estimate -= gradient * step_size\\n\\nBut this pro\\xadgram has the fol\\xadlow\\xading un\\xadusual prop\\xaderty: we can mod\\xadify the vari\\xadable that holds the cur\\xadrent es\\xadti\\xadmate of the square root of two at any point while the pro\\xadgram is run\\xadning, and the al\\xadgorithm will still con\\xadverge to the square root of two. That is, while the code above is run\\xadning, if I drop in with a de\\xadbug\\xadger and over\\xadwrite the cur\\xadrent es\\xadti\\xadmate while the loop is still ex\\xade\\xadcut\\xading, what will hap\\xadpen is that the next gra\\xaddi\\xadent step will start cor\\xadrect\\xading for this per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion, push\\xading the es\\xadti\\xadmate back to\\xadwards the square root of two:\\n\\nIf we give the al\\xadgorithm time to con\\xadverge to within ma\\xadchine pre\\xadci\\xadsion of the ac\\xadtual square root of two then the fi\\xadnal out\\xadput will be bit-for-bit iden\\xadti\\xadcal to the re\\xadsult we would have got\\xadten with\\xadout the per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion.\\nCon\\xadsider this for a mo\\xadment. For most kinds of com\\xadputer code, over\\xadwrit\\xading a vari\\xadable while the code is run\\xadning will ei\\xadther have no effect be\\xadcause the vari\\xadable isn’t used, or it will have a catas\\xadtrophic effect and the code will crash, or it will sim\\xadply cause the code to out\\xadput the wrong an\\xadswer. If I use a de\\xadbug\\xadger to drop in on a web\\xadserver ser\\xadvic\\xading an http re\\xadquest and I over\\xadwrite some vari\\xadable with an ar\\xadbi\\xadtrary value just as the code is perform\\xading a loop in which this vari\\xadable is used in a cen\\xadtral way, bad things are likely to hap\\xadpen! Most com\\xadputer code is not ro\\xadbust to ar\\xadbi\\xadtrary in-flight data mod\\xadifi\\xadca\\xadtions.\\nBut this code that com\\xadputes the square root of two is ro\\xadbust to in-flight data mod\\xadifi\\xadca\\xadtions, or at least the “cur\\xadrent es\\xadti\\xadmate” vari\\xadable is. It’s not that our per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion has no effect: if we change the value, the next iter\\xada\\xadtion of the al\\xadgorithm will com\\xadpute the ob\\xadjec\\xadtive func\\xadtion and its slope at a com\\xadpletely differ\\xadent point, and each iter\\xada\\xadtion af\\xadter that will be differ\\xadent to how it would have been if we hadn’t in\\xadter\\xadvened. The per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion may change the to\\xadtal num\\xadber of iter\\xada\\xadtions be\\xadfore con\\xadver\\xadgence is reached. But ul\\xadti\\xadmately the al\\xadgorithm will still out\\xadput an es\\xadti\\xadmate of the square root of two, and, given time to fully con\\xadverge, it will out\\xadput the ex\\xadact same an\\xadswer it would have out\\xadput with\\xadout the per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion. This is an un\\xadusual breed of com\\xadputer pro\\xadgram in\\xaddeed!\\nWhat is hap\\xadpen\\xading here is that we have con\\xadstructed a phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem con\\xadsist\\xading of a com\\xadputer and a python pro\\xadgram that com\\xadputes the square root of two, such that:\\n\\nfor a set of start\\xading con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions (in this case the set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which the “cur\\xadrent es\\xadti\\xadmate” vari\\xadable is set to each rep\\xadre\\xadsentable float\\xading point num\\xadber),\\n\\nthe sys\\xadtem ex\\xadhibits a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards a small set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions (in this case just the sin\\xadgle con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion in which the “cur\\xadrent es\\xadti\\xadmate” vari\\xadable is set to the square root of two),\\n\\nand this ten\\xaddency is ro\\xadbust to in-flight per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to the sys\\xadtem’s con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion (in this case ro\\xadbust\\xadness is limited to just the di\\xadmen\\xadsions cor\\xadre\\xadspond\\xading to changes in the “cur\\xadrent es\\xadti\\xadmate” vari\\xadable).\\n\\nIn this es\\xadsay I ar\\xadgue that sys\\xadtems that con\\xadverge to some tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion, and will do so de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to the sys\\xadtem, are the sys\\xadtems we should rightly call “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems”.\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: build\\xading a house\\nCon\\xadsider a group of hu\\xadmans build\\xading a house. Let us con\\xadsider the hu\\xadmans to\\xadgether with the build\\xading ma\\xadte\\xadri\\xadals and con\\xadstruc\\xadtion site as a sin\\xadgle phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem. Let us imag\\xadine that we as\\xadsem\\xadble this sys\\xadtem in\\xadside a com\\xadpletely closed cham\\xadber, in\\xadclud\\xading food and sleep\\xading quar\\xadters for the hu\\xadmans, light\\xading, a power source, con\\xadstruc\\xadtion ma\\xadte\\xadri\\xadals, con\\xadstruc\\xadtion blueprint, as well as the phys\\xadi\\xadcal hu\\xadmans with ap\\xadpro\\xadpri\\xadate in\\xadstruc\\xadtions and in\\xadcen\\xadtives to build the house. If we just put these phys\\xadi\\xadcal el\\xade\\xadments to\\xadgether we get a sys\\xadtem that has a ten\\xaddency to evolve un\\xadder the nat\\xadu\\xadral laws of physics to\\xadwards a con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion in which there is a house match\\xading the blueprint.\\n\\nWe could per\\xadturb the sys\\xadtem while the house is be\\xading built — say by drop\\xadping in at night and re\\xadmov\\xading some walls or mov\\xading some con\\xadstruc\\xadtion ma\\xadte\\xadri\\xadals about — and this phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem will re\\xadcover. The team of hu\\xadmans will come in the next day and find the con\\xadstruc\\xadtion ma\\xadte\\xadri\\xadals that were moved, put in new walls to re\\xadplace the ones that were re\\xadmoved, and so on.\\n\\nJust like the square root of two ex\\xadam\\xadple, here is a phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem with:\\n\\nA basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion (all the pos\\xadsi\\xadble ar\\xadrange\\xadments of vi\\xadable hu\\xadmans and build\\xading ma\\xadte\\xadri\\xadals)\\n\\nA tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set that is small rel\\xada\\xadtive to the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion (those in which the build\\xading ma\\xadte\\xadri\\xadals have been ar\\xadranged into a house match\\xading the de\\xadsign)\\n\\nA ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions when start\\xading from any point within the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, de\\xadspite in-flight per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to the system\\n\\nNow this sys\\xadtem is not in\\xadfinitely ro\\xadbust. If we re\\xadally scram\\xadble the ar\\xadrange\\xadment of atoms within this sys\\xadtem then we’ll quickly wind up with a con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion that does not con\\xadtain any hu\\xadmans, or in which the build\\xading ma\\xadte\\xadri\\xadals are ir\\xadre\\xadvo\\xadca\\xadbly de\\xadstroyed, and then we will have a sys\\xadtem with\\xadout the ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards any small set of fi\\xadnal con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions.\\n\\nIn the phys\\xadi\\xadcal world we are not sur\\xadprised to find sys\\xadtems that have this ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards a small set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions. If I pick up my dog while he is sleep\\xading and move him by a few inches, he still finds his way to his wa\\xadter bowl when he wakes up. If I pull a piece of bark off a tree, the tree con\\xadtinues to grow in the same up\\xadward di\\xadrec\\xadtion. If I make a noise that sur\\xadprises a friend work\\xading on some math home\\xadwork, the math home\\xadwork still gets done. Sys\\xadtems that con\\xadtain liv\\xading be\\xadings reg\\xadu\\xadlarly ex\\xadhibit this ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, and tend to do so in a way that is ro\\xadbust to in-flight per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions. As a re\\xadsult we are fa\\xadmil\\xadiar with phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems that have this prop\\xaderty, and we are not sur\\xadprised when they arise in our lives.\\nBut phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems in gen\\xaderal do not have the ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions. If I move a billiard ball a few inches to the left while a bunch of billiard balls are en\\xader\\xadget\\xadi\\xadcally bounc\\xading around a billiard table, the balls are likely to come to rest in a very differ\\xadent po\\xadsi\\xadtion than if I had not moved the ball. If I change the tra\\xadjec\\xadtory of a satel\\xadlite a lit\\xadtle bit, the satel\\xadlite does not have any ten\\xaddency to move back into its old or\\xadbit.\\nThe com\\xadputer sys\\xadtems that we have built are still, by and large, more prim\\xadi\\xadtive than the liv\\xading sys\\xadtems that we in\\xadhabit, and most com\\xadputer sys\\xadtems do not have the ten\\xaddency to evolve ro\\xadbustly to\\xadwards some set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, so op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion al\\xadgorithms as dis\\xadcussed in the pre\\xadvi\\xadous sec\\xadtion, which do have this prop\\xaderty, are some\\xadwhat un\\xadusual.\\nDefin\\xading optimization\\nAn op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem is a sys\\xadtem that has a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards one of a set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions that we will call the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, when started from any con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion within a larger set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, which we call the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, and con\\xadtinues to ex\\xadhibit this ten\\xaddency with re\\xadspect to the same tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions.\\nSome sys\\xadtems may have a sin\\xadgle tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion to\\xadwards which they in\\xadevitably evolve. Ex\\xadam\\xadples are a ball in a steep valley with a sin\\xadgle lo\\xadcal min\\xadi\\xadmum, and a com\\xadputer com\\xadput\\xading the square root of two. Other sys\\xadtems may have a set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions and per\\xadturb\\xading the sys\\xadtem may cause it to evolve to\\xadwards a differ\\xadent mem\\xadber of this set. Ex\\xadam\\xadples are a ball in a valley with mul\\xadti\\xadple lo\\xadcal min\\xadima, or a tree grow\\xading up\\xadwards (per\\xadturb\\xading the tree by, for ex\\xadam\\xadple, cut\\xadting off some branches while it is grow\\xading will prob\\xada\\xadbly change its fi\\xadnal shape, but will not change its ten\\xaddency to grow to\\xadwards one of the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which it has reached its max\\xadi\\xadmum size).\\nWe can quan\\xadtify op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems in the fol\\xadlow\\xading ways.\\nRo\\xadbust\\xadness. Along how many di\\xadmen\\xadsions can we per\\xadturb the sys\\xadtem with\\xadout al\\xadter\\xading its ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set? What mag\\xadni\\xadtude per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion can the sys\\xadtem ab\\xadsorb along these di\\xadmen\\xadsions?

To what ex\\xadtent can we iden\\xadtify sub\\xadsets of the sys\\xadtem cor\\xadre\\xadspond\\xading to “that which is be\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmized” and “that which is do\\xading the op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion”? Between en\\xadg\\xadine and ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion; be\\xadtween agent and world. Highly du\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic sys\\xadtems may be ro\\xadbust to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions of the ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, but brit\\xadtle with re\\xadspect to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions of the en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, a sys\\xadtem con\\xadtain\\xading a 2020s-era robot mov\\xading a vase around is a du\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem: there is a clear sub\\xadset of the sys\\xadtem that is the en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion (the robot), and ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion (the vase). Fur\\xadther\\xadmore, the robot may be able to deal with a wide va\\xadri\\xadety of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment and to the vase, but there are likely to be nu\\xadmer\\xadous small per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to the robot it\\xadself that will ren\\xadder it in\\xadert. In con\\xadtrast, a tree is a non-du\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem: the tree does grow to\\xadwards a set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, but it makes no sense to ask which part of the tree is “do\\xading” the op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion and which part is “be\\xading” op\\xadti\\xadmized.

A sys\\xadtem con\\xadtain\\xading a robot with the goal of mov\\xading a vase to a cer\\xadtain lo\\xadca\\xadtion can be mod\\xadified by mak\\xading just a small num\\xadber of micro\\xadscopic per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to key mem\\xadory reg\\xadisters such that the robot holds the goal of mov\\xading the vase to a differ\\xadent lo\\xadca\\xadtion and the whole vase/\\u200brobot sys\\xadtem now ex\\xadhibits a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards a differ\\xadent tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion.

A tree is an in\\xadter\\xadme\\xaddi\\xadate ex\\xadam\\xadple: to cause the tree to evolve to\\xadwards a differ\\xadent tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set — say, one in which its leaves were of a differ\\xadent shape — one would have to mod\\xadify the ge\\xadnetic code si\\xadmul\\xadta\\xadneously in all of the tree’s cells.\\nRe\\xadla\\xadtion\\xadship to Yud\\xadkowsky’s defi\\xadni\\xadtion of optimization\\nIn Mea\\xadsur\\xading Op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion Power, Eliezer Yud\\xadkowsky defines op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion as a pro\\xadcess in which some part of the world ends up in a con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion that is high in an agent’s prefer\\xadence or\\xadder\\xading, yet has low prob\\xada\\xadbil\\xadity of aris\\xading spon\\xadta\\xadneously. Yud\\xadkowsky’s defi\\xadni\\xadtion asks us to look at a patch of the world that has already un\\xadder\\xadgone op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion by an agent or mind, and draw con\\xadclu\\xadsions about the power or in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence of that mind by ask\\xading how un\\xadlikely it would be for a con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion of equal or greater util\\xadity (to the agent) to arise spon\\xadta\\xadneously.\\nOur defi\\xadni\\xadtion differs from this in the fol\\xadlow\\xading ways:\\n\\nWe look at whole sys\\xadtems that evolve nat\\xadu\\xadrally un\\xadder phys\\xadi\\xadcal laws. We do not as\\xadsume that we can de\\xadcom\\xadpose these sys\\xadtems into some en\\xadg\\xadine and ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, or into mind and en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment. We do not look at sys\\xadtems that are “be\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmized” by some ex\\xadter\\xadnal en\\xadtity but rather at “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems” that ex\\xadhibit a nat\\xadu\\xadral ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. Th\\xadese op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems may con\\xadtain sub\\xadsys\\xadtems that have the prop\\xader\\xadties of agents, but as we will see there are many in\\xadstances of op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems that do not con\\xadtain du\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic agen\\xadtic sub\\xadsys\\xadtems.\\n\\nWhen dis\\xadcern\\xading the bound\\xadary be\\xadtween op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion and non-op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, we look prin\\xadci\\xadpally at ro\\xadbust\\xadness — whether the sys\\xadtem will con\\xadtinue to evolve to\\xadwards its tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set in the face of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions — whereas Yud\\xadkowsky looks at the im\\xadprob\\xada\\xadbil\\xadity of the fi\\xadnal con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion.\\n\\nRe\\xadla\\xadtion\\xadship to Drexler’s Com\\xadpre\\xadhen\\xadsive AI Services\\nEric Drexler has writ\\xadten about the need to con\\xadsider AI sys\\xadtems that are not goal-di\\xadrected agents. He points out that the most eco\\xadnom\\xadi\\xadcally im\\xadpor\\xadtant AI sys\\xadtems to\\xadday are not con\\xadstructed within the agent paradigm, and that in fact agents rep\\xadre\\xadsent just a tiny frac\\xadtion of the de\\xadsign space of in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent sys\\xadtems. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, a sys\\xadtem that iden\\xadti\\xadfies faces in images would be an in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent sys\\xadtem but not an agent ac\\xadcord\\xading to Drexler’s tax\\xadon\\xadomy. This per\\xadspec\\xadtive is highly rele\\xadvant to our dis\\xadcus\\xadsion here since we seek to go be\\xadyond the nar\\xadrow agent model in which in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent sys\\xadtems are con\\xadceived of as uni\\xadtary en\\xadtities that re\\xadceive ob\\xadser\\xadva\\xadtions from the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment, send ac\\xadtions back into the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment, but are oth\\xader\\xadwise sep\\xada\\xadrate from the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment.\\nOur per\\xadspec\\xadtive is that there is a spe\\xadcific class of in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent sys\\xadtems — which we call op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems — that are wor\\xadthy of spe\\xadcial at\\xadten\\xadtion and study due to their po\\xadten\\xadtial to re\\xadshape the world. The set of op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems is smaller than the set of all AI ser\\xadvices, but larger than the set of goal-di\\xadrected agen\\xadtic sys\\xadtems.\\n\\nFigure: re\\xadla\\xadtion\\xadship be\\xadtween our op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem con\\xadcept and Drexler’s tax\\xadon\\xadomy of AI systems\\nEx\\xadam\\xadples of sys\\xadtems that lie in each of these three tiers are as fol\\xadlows:\\n\\nA sys\\xadtem that iden\\xadti\\xadfies faces in images by eval\\xadu\\xadat\\xading a feed-for\\xadward neu\\xadral net\\xadwork is an AI sys\\xadtem but not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem.\\n\\nA tree is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem but not a goal-di\\xadrected agent sys\\xadtem (see sec\\xadtion be\\xadlow an\\xada\\xadlyz\\xading a tree as an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem).\\n\\nA robot with the goal of mov\\xading a ball to a spe\\xadcific des\\xadti\\xadna\\xadtion is a goal-di\\xadrected agent sys\\xadtem.\\n\\nRe\\xadla\\xadtion\\xadship to Garrabrant and Dem\\xadski’s Embed\\xadded Agency\\nScott Garrabrant and Abram Dem\\xadski have writ\\xadten about the many ways that a du\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic view of agency in which one con\\xadceives of a hard sep\\xada\\xadra\\xadtion be\\xadtween agent and en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment fails to cap\\xadture the re\\xadal\\xadity of agents that are re\\xadducible to the same ba\\xadsic build\\xading-blocks as the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadments in which they are em\\xadbed\\xadded. They show that if one starts from a du\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic view of agency then it is difficult to de\\xadsign agents ca\\xadpa\\xadble of re\\xadflect\\xading on and mak\\xading im\\xadprove\\xadments to their own cog\\xadni\\xadtive pro\\xadcesses, since the du\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic view of agency rests on a uni\\xadtary agent whose cog\\xadni\\xadtion does not af\\xadfect the world ex\\xadcept via ex\\xadplicit ac\\xadtions. They also show that rea\\xadson\\xading about coun\\xadter\\xadfac\\xadtu\\xadals be\\xadcomes non\\xadsen\\xadsi\\xadcal if start\\xading from a du\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic view of agency, since the agent’s cog\\xadni\\xadtive pro\\xadcesses are gov\\xaderned by the same phys\\xadi\\xadcal laws as those that gov\\xadern the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment, and the agent can come to no\\xadtice this fact, lead\\xading to con\\xadfu\\xadsion when con\\xadsid\\xader\\xading the con\\xadse\\xadquences ac\\xadtions that are differ\\xadent from the ac\\xadtions that the agent will, in fact, out\\xadput.\\nOne could view the Embed\\xadded Agency work as enu\\xadmer\\xadat\\xading the many log\\xadi\\xadcal pit\\xadfalls one falls into if one takes the “op\\xadti\\xadmizer” con\\xadcept as the start\\xading point for de\\xadsign\\xading in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent sys\\xadtems, rather than “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem” as we pro\\xadpose here. The pre\\xadsent work is strongly in\\xadspired by Garrabrant and Dem\\xadski’s work. Our hope is to point the way to a view of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion and agency that cap\\xadtures re\\xadal\\xadity suffi\\xadciently well to avoid the log\\xadi\\xadcal pit\\xadfalls iden\\xadti\\xadfied in the Embed\\xadded Agency work.\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: ball in a valley\\nCon\\xadsider a phys\\xadi\\xadcal ball rol\\xadling around in a small valley.

As be\\xadfore, the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion is the ball be\\xading at the bot\\xadtom of the valley\\nBasin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion. As be\\xadfore, the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion con\\xadsists of all the pos\\xadsi\\xadble spa\\xadtial lo\\xadca\\xadtions that the ball could be placed in the valley.\\nWe can now per\\xadturb the sys\\xadtem along many more di\\xadmen\\xadsions than in the case where there was no robot. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, we could in\\xadtro\\xadduce a bar\\xadrier that pre\\xadvents the ball from rol\\xadling down\\xadhill past a cer\\xadtain point, and we can then ex\\xadpect a suffi\\xadciently in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent robot to move the ball over the bar\\xadrier. We can ex\\xadpect a suffi\\xadciently well-de\\xadsigned robot to be able to over\\xadcome a wide va\\xadri\\xadety of hur\\xaddles that grav\\xadity would not over\\xadcome on its own. There\\xadfore we say that this sys\\xadtem is more ro\\xadbust than the sys\\xadtem with\\xadout the robot.\\nThere is a se\\xadquence of sys\\xadtems span\\xadning the gap be\\xadtween a ball rol\\xadling in a valley, which is ro\\xadbust to a nar\\xadrow set of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions and there\\xadfore we say ex\\xadhibits a weak de\\xadgree of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, up to a robot with a goal of mov\\xading a ball around in a valley, which is ro\\xadbust to a much wider set of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions, and there\\xadfore we say ex\\xadhibits a stronger de\\xadgree of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion. There\\xadfore the differ\\xadence be\\xadtween sys\\xadtems that do and do not un\\xaddergo op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion is not a bi\\xadnary dis\\xadtinc\\xadtion but a con\\xadtin\\xadu\\xadous gra\\xaddi\\xadent of in\\xadcreas\\xading ro\\xadbust\\xadness to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions.\\nBy in\\xadtro\\xadduc\\xading the robot to the sys\\xadtem we have also in\\xadtro\\xadduced new di\\xadmen\\xadsions along which the sys\\xadtem is frag\\xadile: the di\\xadmen\\xadsions cor\\xadre\\xadspond\\xading to mod\\xadifi\\xadca\\xadtions to the robot it\\xadself, and in par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar the di\\xadmen\\xadsions cor\\xadre\\xadspond\\xading to mod\\xadifi\\xadca\\xadtions to the code run\\xadning on the robot (i.e. phys\\xadi\\xadcal per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion of the mem\\xadory cells in which the code is stored). There are two types of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion we might con\\xadsider:\\n\\nPer\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions that de\\xadstroy the robot. There are nu\\xadmer\\xadous ways we could cut wires or scram\\xadble com\\xadputer code that would leave the robot com\\xadpletely non-op\\xader\\xada\\xadtional. Many of these would be phys\\xadi\\xadcally micro\\xadscopic, such as flip\\xadping a sin\\xadgle bit in a mem\\xadory cell con\\xadtain\\xading some crit\\xadi\\xadcal com\\xadputer code. In fact there are now more ways to break the sys\\xadtem via micro\\xadscopic per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions com\\xadpared to when we were con\\xadsid\\xader\\xading a ball in a valley with\\xadout a robot, since there are few ways to cause a ball not to reach the bot\\xadtom of a valley by mak\\xading only a micro\\xadscopic per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion to the sys\\xadtem, but there are many ways to break mod\\xadern com\\xadputer sys\\xadtems via a micro\\xadscopic per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion.\\n\\nPer\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions that change the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions. We could also make phys\\xadi\\xadcally micro\\xadscopic per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to this sys\\xadtem that change the robot’s goal. For ex\\xadam\\xadple we might flip the sign on some crit\\xadi\\xadcal com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtions in the robot’s code such that the robot works to place the ball at the high\\xadest point rather than the low\\xadest. This is still a phys\\xadi\\xadcal per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion to the valley/\\u200bball/\\u200brobot sys\\xadtem: it is one that af\\xadfects the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion of the mem\\xadory cells con\\xadtain\\xading the robot’s com\\xadputer code. Th\\xadese kinds of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions may point to a con\\xadcept with some similar\\xadity to that of an agent. If we have a sys\\xadtem that can be per\\xadturbed in a way that pre\\xadserves the ro\\xadbust\\xadness of the basin of con\\xadver\\xadgence but changes the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion to\\xadwards which the sys\\xadtem tends to evolve, and if we can find per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions that cause the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions to match our own goals, then we have a way to nav\\xadi\\xadgate be\\xadtween con\\xadver\\xadgence bas\\xadins.\\n\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: com\\xadputer perform\\xading gra\\xaddi\\xadent descent\\nCon\\xadsider now a com\\xadputer run\\xadning an iter\\xada\\xadtive gra\\xaddi\\xadent de\\xadscent al\\xadgorithm in or\\xadder to solve an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem.

Let us fur\\xadther imag\\xadine that the com\\xadputer stores its cur\\xadrent best es\\xadti\\xadmate of the lo\\xadca\\xadtion of the global op\\xadti\\xadmum (which we will hence\\xadforth call the “op\\xadti\\xadmizand”) at some known mem\\xadory lo\\xadca\\xadtion, and up\\xaddates this af\\xadter ev\\xadery iter\\xada\\xadtion of gra\\xaddi\\xadent de\\xadscent.\\nSince this is a purely com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtional pro\\xadcess, it may be tempt\\xading to define the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space at the com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtional level — for ex\\xadam\\xadple by tak\\xading the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space to be the do\\xadmain of the ob\\xadjec\\xadtive func\\xadtion.

The rea\\xadson this is im\\xadpor\\xadtant is to en\\xadsure that we always study com\\xadplete sys\\xadtems, not just some in\\xadert part of the sys\\xadtem that is “be\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmized” by some\\xadthing ex\\xadter\\xadnal to the sys\\xadtem. There\\xadfore we an\\xada\\xadlyze this sys\\xadtem as fol\\xadlows.\\nCon\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space. The sys\\xadtem con\\xadsists of a phys\\xadi\\xadcal com\\xadputer run\\xadning some code that performs gra\\xaddi\\xadent de\\xadscent. The con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions of the sys\\xadtem are the phys\\xadi\\xadcal con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions of the atoms com\\xadpris\\xading the com\\xadputer.\\nTar\\xadget-con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. The tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set con\\xadsists of the set of phys\\xadi\\xadcal con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions of the com\\xadputer in which the mem\\xadory cells that store the cur\\xadrent op\\xadti\\xadmized state con\\xadtain the true lo\\xadca\\xadtion of the global op\\xadti\\xadmum (or the clos\\xadest float\\xading point rep\\xadre\\xadsen\\xadta\\xadtion of it).\\nBasin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion. The basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion con\\xadsists of the set of phys\\xadi\\xadcal con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which there is a vi\\xadable com\\xadputer and it is run\\xadning the gra\\xaddi\\xadent de\\xadscent al\\xadgorithm.\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: billiard balls\\nLet us now ex\\xadam\\xadine a sys\\xadtem that is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem ac\\xadcord\\xading to our defi\\xadni\\xadtion. Con\\xadsider a billiard table with some billiard balls that are cur\\xadrently bounc\\xading around in mo\\xadtion. Left alone, the balls will even\\xadtu\\xadally come to rest in some con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion. Is this an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem?\\nIn or\\xadder to qual\\xadify as an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, a sys\\xadtem must (1) have a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards a set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions that are small rel\\xada\\xadtive to the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, and (2) con\\xadtinue to evolve to\\xadwards the same set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions if per\\xadturbed.\\nIf we reach in while the billiard balls are bounc\\xading around and move one of the balls that is in mo\\xadtion, the sys\\xadtem will now come to rest in a differ\\xadent con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion. There\\xadfore this is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, be\\xadcause there is no set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions to\\xadwards which the sys\\xadtem evolves de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions. A sys\\xadtem does not need to be ro\\xadbust along all di\\xadmen\\xadsions in or\\xadder to be an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, but a billiard table ex\\xadhibits no such ro\\xadbust di\\xadmen\\xadsions at all, so it is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem.\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: satel\\xadlite in orbit\\nCon\\xadsider a sec\\xadond ex\\xadam\\xadple of a sys\\xadtem that is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem: a satel\\xadlite in or\\xadbit around Earth. Un\\xadlike the billiard balls, there is no chaotic ten\\xaddency for small per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to lead to large de\\xadvi\\xada\\xadtions in the sys\\xadtem’s evolu\\xadtion, but nei\\xadther is there any ten\\xaddency for the sys\\xadtem to come back to some tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion when per\\xadturbed. If we per\\xadturb the satel\\xadlite’s ve\\xadloc\\xadity or po\\xadsi\\xadtion, then from that point on it is in a differ\\xadent or\\xadbit and has no ten\\xaddency to re\\xadturn to its pre\\xadvi\\xadous or\\xadbit. There is no set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions to\\xadwards which the sys\\xadtem evolves de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions, so this is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem.\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: a tree\\nCon\\xadsider a patch of fer\\xadtile ground with a tree grow\\xading in it. Is this an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem?\\nCon\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space. For the sake of con\\xadcrete\\xadness let us take a re\\xadgion of space that is sealed off from the out\\xadside world — say 100m x 100m x 100m. This re\\xadgion is filled at the bot\\xadtom with fer\\xadtile soil and at the top with an at\\xadmo\\xadsphere con\\xadducive to the tree’s growth. Let us say that the re\\xadgion con\\xadtains a sin\\xadgle tree.\\nWe will an\\xada\\xadlyze this sys\\xadtem in terms of the ar\\xadrange\\xadment of atoms in\\xadside this re\\xadgion of space. Out of all the pos\\xadsi\\xadble con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions of these atoms, the vast ma\\xadjor\\xadity con\\xadsist of a uniform hazy gas. An as\\xadtro\\xadnom\\xadi\\xadcally tiny frac\\xadtion of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions con\\xadtain a non-triv\\xadial mass of com\\xadplex biolog\\xadi\\xadcal nu\\xadtri\\xadents mak\\xading up soil. An even tinier frac\\xadtion of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions con\\xadtain a vi\\xadable tree.\\nTar\\xadget-con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. A tree has a ten\\xaddency to grow taller over time, to sprout more branches and leaves, and so on. Fur\\xadther\\xadmore, trees can only grow so tall due to the physics of trans\\xadport\\xading sug\\xadars up and down the trunk. So we can iden\\xadtify a set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which the atoms in our re\\xadgion of space are ar\\xadranged into a tree that has grown to its max\\xadi\\xadmum size (has sprouted as many branches and leaves as it can sup\\xadport given the at\\xadmo\\xadsphere, the soil that it is grow\\xading in, and the con\\xadstraints of its own biol\\xadogy). There are many topolo\\xadgies in which the tree’s branches could di\\xadvide, many po\\xadsi\\xadtions that leaves could sprout in, and so on, so there are many con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions within the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. But this set is still tiny com\\xadpared to all the ways that the same atoms could be ar\\xadranged with\\xadout the con\\xadstraint of form\\xading a vi\\xadable tree.\\nBasin of con\\xadver\\xadgence. This sys\\xadtem will evolve to\\xadwards the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set start\\xading from any con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion in which there is a vi\\xadable tree. This in\\xadcludes con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which there is just a seed in the ground, as well as con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which there is a tree of small, medium, or large size. Start\\xading from any of these con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, if we leave the sys\\xadtem to evolve un\\xadder the nat\\xadu\\xadral laws of physics then the tree will grow to\\xadwards its max\\xadi\\xadmum size, at which point the sys\\xadtem will be in one of the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions.\\nRo\\xadbust\\xadness to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions. This sys\\xadtem is highly ro\\xadbust to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions. Con\\xadsider per\\xadturb\\xading the sys\\xadtem in any of the fol\\xadlow\\xading ways:\\n\\nMov\\xading soil from one place to another\\n\\nRe\\xadmov\\xading some leaves from the tree\\n\\nCut\\xadting a branch off the tree\\n\\nTh\\xadese per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions might change which par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion is even\\xadtu\\xadally reached — the par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar ar\\xadrange\\xadment of branches and leaves in the tree once it reaches its max\\xadi\\xadmum size — but they will not stop the tree from grow\\xading taller and evolv\\xading to\\xadwards a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion. In fact we could cut the tree right at the base of the trunk and it would con\\xadtinue to evolve to\\xadwards a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion by sprout\\xading a new trunk and grow\\xading a whole new tree.\\nDual\\xadity. A tree is a non-du\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem. There is no sub\\xadsys\\xadtem that is re\\xadspon\\xadsi\\xadble for “do\\xading” the op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, sep\\xada\\xadrately from that which is “be\\xading” op\\xadti\\xadmized. Yet the tree does ex\\xadhibit a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards a set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, and can over\\xadcome a wide va\\xadri\\xadety of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions in or\\xadder to do so. There are no man-made sys\\xadtems in ex\\xadis\\xadtence to\\xadday that are ca\\xadpa\\xadble of gath\\xader\\xading and uti\\xadliz\\xading re\\xadsources so flex\\xadibly as a tree, from so broad a va\\xadri\\xadety of en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadments, and there are cer\\xadtainly no man-made sys\\xadtems that can re\\xadcover from be\\xading phys\\xadi\\xadcally dis\\xadmem\\xadbered to such an ex\\xadtent that a tree can re\\xadcover from be\\xading cut at the trunk.\\nAt this point it may be tempt\\xading to say that the en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion is nat\\xadu\\xadral se\\xadlec\\xadtion. But re\\xadcall that we are study\\xading just a sin\\xadgle tree grow\\xading from seed to max\\xadi\\xadmum size. Can you iden\\xadtify a phys\\xadi\\xadcal sub\\xadset of our 100m x 100m x 100m re\\xadgion of space that is this en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, analo\\xadgous to how we iden\\xadti\\xadfied a phys\\xadi\\xadcal sub\\xadset of the robot-and-ball sys\\xadtem as the en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion (i.e. the phys\\xadi\\xadcal robot)? Nat\\xadu\\xadral se\\xadlec\\xadtion might be the pro\\xadcess by which the ini\\xadtial sys\\xadtem came into ex\\xadis\\xadtence, but it is not the pro\\xadcess that drives the growth of the tree to\\xadwards a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion.\\nIt may then be tempt\\xading to say that it is the tree’s DNA that is the en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion. It is true that the tree’s DNA ex\\xadhibits some char\\xadac\\xadter\\xadis\\xadtics of an en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion: it re\\xadmains un\\xadchanged through\\xadout the life of the tree, and phys\\xadi\\xadcally micro\\xadscopic per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to it can dis\\xadable the tree. But a tree repli\\xadcates its DNA in each of its cells, and per\\xadturb\\xading just one or a small num\\xadber of these is not likely to af\\xadfect the tree’s over\\xadall growth tra\\xadjec\\xadtory. More im\\xadpor\\xadtantly, a sin\\xadgle strand of DNA does not re\\xadally have agency on its own: it re\\xadquires the molec\\xadu\\xadlar ma\\xadchin\\xadery of the whole cell to syn\\xadthe\\xadsize pro\\xadteins based on the ge\\xadnetic code in the DNA, and the phys\\xadi\\xadcal ma\\xadchin\\xadery of the whole tree to col\\xadlect and de\\xadploy en\\xadergy, wa\\xadter, and nu\\xadtri\\xadents. Just as it would be in\\xadcor\\xadrect to iden\\xadtify the mem\\xadory reg\\xadisters con\\xadtain\\xading com\\xadputer code within a robot as the “true” en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion sep\\xada\\xadrate from the rest of the com\\xadput\\xading and phys\\xadi\\xadcal ma\\xadchin\\xadery that brings this code to life, it is not quite ac\\xadcu\\xadrate to iden\\xadtify DNA as an en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion. A tree sim\\xadply does not de\\xadcom\\xadpose into en\\xadg\\xadine and ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion.\\nIt may also be tempt\\xading to ask whether the tree can “re\\xadally” be said to be un\\xadder\\xadgo\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion in the ab\\xadsence of any “in\\xadten\\xadtion” to reach one of the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions. But this ex\\xadpec\\xadta\\xadtion of a cen\\xadtral\\xadized mind with cen\\xadtral\\xadized in\\xadten\\xadtions is re\\xadally an ar\\xadti\\xadfact of us pro\\xadject\\xading our view of our self onto the world: we be\\xadlieve that we have a cen\\xadtral\\xadized mind with cen\\xadtral\\xadized in\\xadten\\xadtions, so we fo\\xadcus our at\\xadten\\xadtion on op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems with a similar struc\\xadture. But this turns out to be mis\\xadguided on two counts: first, the vast ma\\xadjor\\xadity of op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems do not con\\xadtain cen\\xadtral\\xadized minds, and sec\\xadond, our own minds are ac\\xadtu\\xadally far less cen\\xadtral\\xadized than we think! For now we put this ques\\xadtion of whether op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion re\\xadquires in\\xadten\\xadtions and in\\xadstead just work within our defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems, which a tree definitely satis\\xadfies.\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: bot\\xadtle cap\\nDaniel Filan has pointed out that some defi\\xadni\\xadtions of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion would non\\xadsen\\xadsi\\xadcally clas\\xadsify a bot\\xadtle cap as an op\\xadti\\xadmizer, since a bot\\xadtle cap causes wa\\xadter molecules in a bot\\xadtle to stay in\\xadside the bot\\xadtle, and the set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which the molecules are in\\xadside a bot\\xadtle is much smaller than the set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which the molecules are each al\\xadlowed to take a po\\xadsi\\xadtion ei\\xadther in\\xadside or out\\xadside the bot\\xadtle.\\nIn our frame\\xadwork we have the fol\\xadlow\\xading:\\n\\nThe sys\\xadtem con\\xadsists of a bot\\xadtle, a bot\\xadtle cap, and wa\\xadter molecules.

To be an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem there must be a ten\\xaddency to evolve from any con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion within a basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion to\\xadwards a smaller tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, but in this case the sys\\xadtem merely re\\xadmains within the set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which the wa\\xadter molecules are in\\xadside the bot\\xadtle. This is no differ\\xadent from a rock sit\\xadting on a beach: due to ba\\xadsic chem\\xadistry there is a ten\\xaddency to re\\xadmain within the set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which the molecules com\\xadpris\\xading the rock are phys\\xadi\\xadcally bound to one an\\xadother, but it has no ten\\xaddency to evolve from a wide basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion to\\xadwards a small set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion.\\nSe\\xadcond, the bot\\xadtle cap sys\\xadtem is not ro\\xadbust to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions since if we per\\xadturb the po\\xadsi\\xadtion of a sin\\xadgle wa\\xadter molecule so that it is out\\xadside the bot\\xadtle, there is no ten\\xaddency for it to move back in\\xadside the bot\\xadtle. This is re\\xadally just the first point above restated, since if there were a ten\\xaddency for wa\\xadter molecules moved out\\xadside the bot\\xadtle to evolve back to\\xadwards a con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion in which all the wa\\xadter molecules were in\\xadside the bot\\xadtle, then we would have a basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion larger than the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set.\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: the hu\\xadman liver\\nFilan also asks whether one’s liver should be con\\xadsid\\xadered an op\\xadti\\xadmizer. Sup\\xadpose we ob\\xadserve a hu\\xadman work\\xading to make money. If this per\\xadson were de\\xadprived of a liver, or if their liver stopped func\\xadtion\\xading, they would pre\\xadsum\\xadably be un\\xadable to make money. So are we then to view the liver as an op\\xadti\\xadmizer work\\xading to\\xadwards the goal of mak\\xading money? Filan asks this ques\\xadtion as a challenge to Yud\\xadkowsky’s defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, since it seems ab\\xadsurd to view one’s liver as an op\\xadti\\xadmizer work\\xading to\\xadwards the goal of mak\\xading money, yet Yud\\xadkowsky’s defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion might clas\\xadsify it as such.\\nIn our frame\\xadwork we have the fol\\xadlow\\xading:\\n\\nThe sys\\xadtem con\\xadsists of a hu\\xadman work\\xading to make money, to\\xadgether with the whole hu\\xadman econ\\xadomy and world.\\n\\nThe basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion con\\xadsists of the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions in which there is a healthy hu\\xadman (with a healthy liver) hav\\xading the goal of mak\\xading money\\n\\nThe tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions are those in which this per\\xadson’s bank bal\\xadance is high. (In\\xadter\\xadest\\xadingly there is no up\\xadper bound here, so there is no fixed point but rather a con\\xadtin\\xadu\\xadous gra\\xaddi\\xadent.)\\n\\nWe can ex\\xadpect that this per\\xadson is ca\\xadpa\\xadble of over\\xadcom\\xading a rea\\xadson\\xadably broad va\\xadri\\xadety of ob\\xadsta\\xadcles in pur\\xadsuit of mak\\xading money, so we rec\\xadog\\xadnize that this over\\xadall sys\\xadtem (the hu\\xadman to\\xadgether with the whole econ\\xadomy) is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem. But Filan would surely agree on this point and his ques\\xadtion is more spe\\xadcific: he is ask\\xading whether the liver is an op\\xadti\\xadmizer.\\nIn gen\\xaderal we can\\xadnot ex\\xadpect to de\\xadcom\\xadpose op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems into an en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion and ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion. We can see that the sys\\xadtem has the char\\xadac\\xadter\\xadis\\xadtics of an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, and we may iden\\xadtify parts, in\\xadclud\\xading in this case the per\\xadson’s liver, that are nec\\xades\\xadsary for these char\\xadac\\xadter\\xadis\\xadtics to ex\\xadist, but we can\\xadnot in gen\\xaderal iden\\xadtify any crisp sub\\xadset of the sys\\xadtem as that which is do\\xading the op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion. And pick\\xading var\\xadi\\xadous sub\\xadcom\\xadpo\\xadnents of the sys\\xadtem (such as the per\\xadson’s liver) and ask\\xading “is this the part that is do\\xading the op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion?” does not in gen\\xaderal have an an\\xadswer.\\nBy anal\\xadogy, sup\\xadpose we looked at a planet or\\xadbit\\xading a star and asked: “which part here is do\\xading the or\\xadbit\\xading?” Is it the planet or the star that is the “en\\xadg\\xadine of or\\xadbit\\xading”? Or sup\\xadpose we looked at a car and no\\xadticed that the fuel pump is a com\\xadplex piece of ma\\xadchin\\xadery with\\xadout which the car’s lo\\xadco\\xadmo\\xadtion would cease. We might ask: is this fuel pump the true “en\\xadg\\xadine of lo\\xadco\\xadmo\\xadtion”? Th\\xadese ques\\xadtions don’t have an\\xadswers be\\xadcause they mis\\xadtak\\xadenly pre\\xadsup\\xadpose that we can iden\\xadtify a sub\\xadsys\\xadtem that is uniquely re\\xadspon\\xadsi\\xadble for the or\\xadbit\\xading of the planet or the lo\\xadco\\xadmo\\xadtion of the car. Ask\\xading whether a hu\\xadman liver is an “op\\xadti\\xadmizer” is similarly mis\\xadtaken: we can see that the liver is a com\\xadplex piece of ma\\xadchin\\xadery that is nec\\xades\\xadsary in or\\xadder for the over\\xadall sys\\xadtem to ex\\xadhibit the char\\xadac\\xadter\\xadis\\xadtics of an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem (ro\\xadbust evolu\\xadtion to\\xadwards a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set), but be\\xadyond this it makes no more sense to ask whether the liver is a true “lo\\xadcus of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion”.\\nSo rather than an\\xadswer\\xading Filan’s ques\\xadtion in ei\\xadther the pos\\xadi\\xadtive or the nega\\xadtive, the ap\\xadpro\\xadpri\\xadate move is to dis\\xadsolve the con\\xadcept of an op\\xadti\\xadmizer, and in\\xadstead ask whether the over\\xadall sys\\xadtem is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem.\\nEx\\xadam\\xadple: the uni\\xadverse as a whole\\nCon\\xadsider the whole phys\\xadi\\xadcal uni\\xadverse as a sin\\xadgle closed sys\\xadtem. Is this an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem?\\nThe sec\\xadond law of ther\\xadmo\\xaddy\\xadnam\\xadics tells us that the uni\\xadverse is evolv\\xading to\\xadwards a max\\xadi\\xadmally di\\xads\\xador\\xaddered ther\\xadmo\\xaddy\\xadnamic equil\\xadibrium in which it cy\\xadcles through var\\xadi\\xadous max\\xaden\\xadtropy con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion. We might then imag\\xadine that the uni\\xadverse is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem in which the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion is all pos\\xadsi\\xadble con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions of mat\\xadter and en\\xadergy, and the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set con\\xadsists of the max\\xaden\\xadtropy con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions.\\nHow\\xadever, this is not quite ac\\xadcu\\xadrate. Out of all pos\\xadsi\\xadble con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions of the uni\\xadverse, the vast ma\\xadjor\\xadity of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions are at or close to max\\xadi\\xadmum en\\xadtropy. That is, if we sam\\xadple a con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion of the uni\\xadverse at ran\\xaddom, we have only an as\\xadtro\\xadnom\\xadi\\xadcally tiny chance of find\\xading any\\xadthing other than a close-to-uniform gas of ba\\xadsic par\\xadti\\xadcles. If we define the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion as all pos\\xadsi\\xadble con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions of mat\\xadter in the uni\\xadverse and the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set as the set of max\\xaden\\xadtropy con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, then the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set ac\\xadtu\\xadally con\\xadtains al\\xadmost the en\\xadtirety of the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, with the only con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions that are in the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion but not the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set be\\xading the highly un\\xadusual con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions of mat\\xadter con\\xadtain\\xading stars, galax\\xadies, and so on.\\n\\nFor this rea\\xadson the uni\\xadverse as a whole does not qual\\xadify as an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem un\\xadder our defi\\xadni\\xadtion. (Or per\\xadhaps it would be more ac\\xadcu\\xadrate to say that it qual\\xadifies as an ex\\xadtremely weak op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem.)\\nPower sources and entropy\\nThe sec\\xadond law of ther\\xadmo\\xaddy\\xadnam\\xadics tells us that any closed sys\\xadtem will even\\xadtu\\xadally tend to\\xadwards a max\\xadi\\xadmally di\\xads\\xador\\xaddered state in which mat\\xadter and en\\xadergy is spread ap\\xadprox\\xadi\\xadmately uniformly through space. So if we were to iso\\xadlate one of the sys\\xadtems ex\\xadplore above in\\xadside a sealed cham\\xadber and leave it for a very long pe\\xadriod then even\\xadtu\\xadally what\\xadever power source we put in\\xadside the sealed cham\\xadber would be\\xadcome de\\xadpleted, and then even\\xadtu\\xadally af\\xadter that ev\\xadery com\\xadplex ma\\xadte\\xadrial or com\\xadpound in the sys\\xadtem would de\\xadgrade into its base prod\\xaducts, and then fi\\xadnally we would be left with a cham\\xadber filled with a uniform gaseous mix\\xadture of what\\xadever base el\\xade\\xadments we origi\\xadnally put in.\\nSo in this sense there are no op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems at all, since any of the sys\\xadtems above evolve to\\xadwards their tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion sets only for a finite pe\\xadriod of time, af\\xadter which they de\\xadgrade and evolve to\\xadwards a max\\xaden\\xadtropy con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion.\\nThis is not a very se\\xadri\\xadous challenge to our defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion since it is com\\xadmon through\\xadout physics and com\\xadputer sci\\xadence to study var\\xadi\\xadous “steady-state” or “fixed point” sys\\xadtems even though the same ob\\xadjec\\xadtion could be made about any of them. We say that a ther\\xadmome\\xadter can be used to build a heat reg\\xadu\\xadla\\xadtor that will keep the tem\\xadper\\xada\\xadture of a house within a de\\xadsired range, and we do not usu\\xadally need to add the caveat that even\\xadtu\\xadally the house and reg\\xadu\\xadla\\xadtor will de\\xadgrade into a uniform gaseous mix\\xadture due to the heat death of the uni\\xadverse.\\nNev\\xader\\xadthe\\xadless, two pos\\xadsi\\xadble ways to re\\xadfine our defi\\xadni\\xadtion are:\\n\\nWe could stipu\\xadlate that some power source is pro\\xadvided ex\\xadter\\xadnally to each sys\\xadtem we an\\xada\\xadlyze, and then perform our anal\\xady\\xadsis con\\xaddi\\xadtional on the ex\\xadis\\xadtence of that power source.\\n\\nWe could spec\\xadify a finite time hori\\xadzon and say that “a sys\\xadtem is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem if it tends to\\xadwards a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set up to time T”.\\n\\nCon\\xadnec\\xadtion to dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems theory\\nThe con\\xadcept of “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem” in this es\\xadsay is very close to that of a dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem with one or more at\\xadtrac\\xadtors. We offer the fol\\xadlow\\xading re\\xadmarks on this con\\xadnec\\xadtion.\\n\\nA gen\\xaderal dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem is any sys\\xadtem with a state that evolves over time as a func\\xadtion of the state it\\xadself. This en\\xadcom\\xadpasses a very broad range of sys\\xadtems in\\xaddeed!\\n\\nIn dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem the\\xadory, an at\\xadtrac\\xadtor is the term used for what we have called the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. A fixed point at\\xadtrac\\xadtor is, in our lan\\xadguage, a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set with just one el\\xade\\xadment, such as when com\\xadput\\xading the square root of two. A limit cy\\xadcle is, in our lan\\xadguage, a sys\\xadtem that even\\xadtu\\xadally sta\\xadbly loops through a se\\xadquence of states all of which are in the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, such as a satel\\xadlite in or\\xadbit.\\n\\nWe have dis\\xadcussed sys\\xadtems that evolve to\\xadwards tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions along some di\\xadmen\\xadsions but not oth\\xaders (e.g. ball in a valley). We have not yet dis\\xadcov\\xadered whether dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems the\\xadory ex\\xadplic\\xaditly stud\\xadies at\\xadtrac\\xadtors that op\\xader\\xadate along a sub\\xadset of the sys\\xadtem’s di\\xadmen\\xadsions.\\n\\nThere is a con\\xadcept of “well-posed\\xadness” in dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems the\\xadory that jus\\xadtifies the iden\\xadti\\xadfi\\xadca\\xadtion of a math\\xade\\xadmat\\xadi\\xadcal model with a phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem. The con\\xaddi\\xadtions for a model to be well-posed are (1) that a solu\\xadtion ex\\xadists (i.e. the model is not self-con\\xadtra\\xaddic\\xadtory), (2) that there is a unique solu\\xadtion (i.e. the model con\\xadtains enough in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion to pick out a sin\\xadgle sys\\xadtem tra\\xadjec\\xadtory), and (3) that the solu\\xadtion changes con\\xadtin\\xadu\\xadously with the ini\\xadtial con\\xaddi\\xadtions (the be\\xadhav\\xadior of the sys\\xadtem is not too chaotic). This third con\\xaddi\\xadtion may pre\\xadsent an in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading av\\xadenue for fu\\xadture in\\xadves\\xadti\\xadga\\xadtion as it seems re\\xadlated to but not quite equiv\\xada\\xadlent to our no\\xadtion of ro\\xadbust\\xadness since ro\\xadbust\\xadness as we define it ad\\xaddi\\xadtion\\xadally re\\xadquires that the sys\\xadtem con\\xadtinue to evolve to\\xadwards the same at\\xadtrac\\xadtor state de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions. Ex\\xadplor\\xading this con\\xadnec\\xadtion may pre\\xadsent an in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading av\\xadenue for fu\\xadture in\\xadves\\xadti\\xadga\\xadtion.\\n\\nConclusion\\nWe have pro\\xadposed a con\\xadcept that we call “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems” to de\\xadscribe sys\\xadtems that have a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards a nar\\xadrow tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set when started from any point within a broader basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, and con\\xadtinue to do so de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions.\\nWe have an\\xada\\xadlyzed op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems along three di\\xadmen\\xadsions:\\n\\nRo\\xadbust\\xadness, which mea\\xadsures the num\\xadber of di\\xadmen\\xadsions along which the sys\\xadtem is ro\\xadbust to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions, and the mag\\xadni\\xadtude of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion along these di\\xadmen\\xadsions that the sys\\xadtem can with\\xadstand.\\n\\nDual\\xadity, which mea\\xadsures the ex\\xadtent to which an ap\\xadprox\\xadi\\xadmate “en\\xadg\\xadine of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion” sub\\xadsys\\xadtem can be iden\\xadti\\xadfied.\\n\\nRe\\xadtar\\xadgetabil\\xadity, which mea\\xadsures the ex\\xadtent to which the sys\\xadtem can be trans\\xadformed via micro\\xadscopic per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions into an equally ro\\xadbust op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem but with a differ\\xadent tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set.\\n\\nWe have ar\\xadgued that the “op\\xadti\\xadmizer” con\\xadcept rests on an as\\xadsump\\xadtion that op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems can be de\\xadcom\\xadposed into en\\xadg\\xadine and ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion (or agent and en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment, or mind and world). We have de\\xadscribed sys\\xadtems that do ex\\xadhibit op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion yet can\\xadnot be de\\xadcom\\xadposed this way, such as the tree ex\\xadam\\xadple. We have also pointed out that, even among those sys\\xadtems that can be de\\xadcom\\xadposed ap\\xadprox\\xadi\\xadmately into en\\xadg\\xadine and ob\\xadject of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion (for ex\\xadam\\xadple, a robot mov\\xading a ball around), we will not in gen\\xaderal be able to mean\\xadingfully an\\xadswer the ques\\xadtion of whether ar\\xadbi\\xadtrary sub\\xadcom\\xadpo\\xadnents of the agent are an op\\xadti\\xadmizer not (c.f. the hu\\xadman liver ex\\xadam\\xadple).\\nThere\\xadfore, while the “op\\xadti\\xadmizer” con\\xadcept clearly still has much util\\xadity in de\\xadsign\\xading in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent sys\\xadtems, we should be cau\\xadtious about tak\\xading it as a prim\\xadi\\xadtive in our un\\xadder\\xadstand\\xading of the world. In par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar we should not ex\\xadpect ques\\xadtions of the form “is X an op\\xadti\\xadmizer?” to always have an\\xadswers.What links here?Cyborgism by NicholasKees (10 Feb 2023 14:47 UTC; 328 points)Why Agent Foun\\xadda\\xadtions?

This is po\\xadten\\xadtially valuable since “op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion” is a word of\\xadten used in dis\\xadcus\\xadsions about AI risk, and much con\\xadfu\\xadsion can fol\\xadlow from sloppy use of the term or from differ\\xadent peo\\xadple un\\xadder\\xadstand\\xading it differ\\xadently. While the defi\\xadni\\xadtion given here is a use\\xadful per\\xadspec\\xadtive, I have some reser\\xadva\\xadtions about the claims made about its rele\\xadvance and ap\\xadpli\\xadca\\xadtions.\\nThe key para\\xadgraph, which sum\\xadma\\xadrizes the defi\\xadni\\xadtion it\\xadself, is the fol\\xadlow\\xading:\\n\\nAn op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem is a sys\\xadtem that has a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards one of a set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions that we will call the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, when started from any con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion within a larger set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, which we call the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, and con\\xadtinues to ex\\xadhibit this ten\\xaddency with re\\xadspect to the same tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions.\\n\\nIn fact, “con\\xadtinues to ex\\xadhibit this ten\\xaddency with re\\xadspect to the same tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions” is re\\xaddun\\xaddant: clearly as long as the per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion doesn’t push the sys\\xadtem out of the basin, the ten\\xaddency must con\\xadtinue.\\nThis is what is known as “at\\xadtrac\\xadtor” in dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems the\\xadory. For com\\xadpar\\xadi\\xadson, here is the defi\\xadni\\xadtion of “at\\xadtrac\\xadtor” from the Wikipe\\xaddia:\\n\\nIn the math\\xade\\xadmat\\xadi\\xadcal field of dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems, an at\\xadtrac\\xadtor is a set of states to\\xadward which a sys\\xadtem tends to evolve, for a wide va\\xadri\\xadety of start\\xading con\\xaddi\\xadtions of the sys\\xadtem. Sys\\xadtem val\\xadues that get close enough to the at\\xadtrac\\xadtor val\\xadues re\\xadmain close even if slightly dis\\xadturbed.\\n\\nThe au\\xadthor ac\\xadknowl\\xadedges this con\\xadnec\\xadtion, al\\xadthough he also makes the fol\\xadlow\\xading re\\xadmark:\\n\\nWe have dis\\xadcussed sys\\xadtems that evolve to\\xadwards tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions along some di\\xadmen\\xadsions but not oth\\xaders (e.g. ball in a valley). We have not yet dis\\xadcov\\xadered whether dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems the\\xadory ex\\xadplic\\xaditly stud\\xadies at\\xadtrac\\xadtors that op\\xader\\xadate along a sub\\xadset of the sys\\xadtem’s di\\xadmen\\xadsions.\\n\\nI find this re\\xadmark con\\xadfus\\xading. An at\\xadtrac\\xadtor that op\\xader\\xadates along a sub\\xadset of the di\\xadmen\\xadsion is just an at\\xadtrac\\xadtor sub\\xadman\\xadi\\xadfold. This is com\\xadpletely stan\\xaddard in dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems the\\xadory.\\nGiven that the defi\\xadni\\xadtion it\\xadself is not es\\xadpe\\xadcially novel, the post’s main claim to value is via the ap\\xadpli\\xadca\\xadtions. Un\\xadfor\\xadtu\\xadnately, some of the pro\\xadposed ap\\xadpli\\xadca\\xadtions seem to me poorly jus\\xadtified. Speci\\xadfi\\xadcally, I want to talk about two ma\\xadjor ex\\xadam\\xadples: the claimed re\\xadla\\xadtion\\xadship to em\\xadbed\\xadded agency and the claimed re\\xadla\\xadtions to com\\xadpre\\xadhen\\xadsive AI ser\\xadvices.\\nIn both cases, the main short\\xadcom\\xading of the defi\\xadni\\xadtion is that there is an es\\xadsen\\xadtial prop\\xaderty of AI that this defi\\xadni\\xadtion doesn’t cap\\xadture at all. The au\\xadthor does ac\\xadknowl\\xadedge that “goal-di\\xadrected agent sys\\xadtem” is a dis\\xadtinct con\\xadcept from “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems”. How\\xadever, he doesn’t ex\\xadplain how are they dis\\xadtinct.\\nOne way to for\\xadmu\\xadlate the differ\\xadence is as fol\\xadlows: agency = op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion + learn\\xading. An agent is not just ca\\xadpa\\xadble of steer\\xading a par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar uni\\xadverse to\\xadwards a cer\\xadtain out\\xadcome, it is ca\\xadpa\\xadble of steer\\xading an en\\xadtire class of uni\\xadverses, with\\xadout know\\xading in ad\\xadvance in which uni\\xadverse it was placed. This un\\xadder\\xadlies all of RL the\\xadory, this is im\\xadplicit in the Shane-Legg defi\\xadni\\xadtion of in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence and my own[1], this is what Yud\\xadkowsky calls “cross do\\xadmain”.\\nThe is\\xadsue of learn\\xading is not just nit\\xadpick\\xading, it is cru\\xadcial to delineate the bound\\xadary around “AI risk”, and delineat\\xading the bound\\xadary is cru\\xadcial to con\\xadstruc\\xadtively think of solu\\xadtions. If we ig\\xadnore learn\\xading and just talk about “op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion risks” then we will have to in\\xadclude the risk of pan\\xaddemics (be\\xadcause bac\\xadte\\xadria are op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for in\\xadfec\\xadtion), the risk of false vac\\xaduum col\\xadlapse in par\\xadti\\xadcle ac\\xadcel\\xader\\xada\\xadtors (be\\xadcause vac\\xaduum bub\\xadbles are op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for ex\\xadpand\\xading), the risk of run\\xadaway global warm\\xading (be\\xadcause it is op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for in\\xadcreas\\xading tem\\xadper\\xada\\xadture) et cetera. But, these are very differ\\xadent risks that re\\xadquire very differ\\xadent solu\\xadtions.\\nThere is an\\xadother, less cen\\xadtral, differ\\xadence: the au\\xadthor re\\xadquires a par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar set of “tar\\xadget states” whereas in the con\\xadtext of agency it is more nat\\xadu\\xadral to con\\xadsider util\\xadity func\\xadtions, which means there is a con\\xadtin\\xadu\\xadous gra\\xadda\\xadtion of states rather than just “good states” and “bad states”. This is re\\xadlated to the differ\\xadence the au\\xadthor points out be\\xadtween his defi\\xadni\\xadtion and Yud\\xadkowsky’s:\\n\\nWhen dis\\xadcern\\xading the bound\\xadary be\\xadtween op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion and non-op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, we look prin\\xadci\\xadpally at ro\\xadbust\\xadness — whether the sys\\xadtem will con\\xadtinue to evolve to\\xadwards its tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set in the face of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions — whereas Yud\\xadkowsky looks at the im\\xadprob\\xada\\xadbil\\xadity of the fi\\xadnal con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion.\\n\\nThe im\\xadprob\\xada\\xadbil\\xadity of the fi\\xadnal con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion is a con\\xadtin\\xadu\\xadous met\\xadric, whereas just ar\\xadriv\\xading or not ar\\xadriv\\xading at a par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar set is dis\\xadcrete.\\nLet’s see how this short\\xadcom\\xading af\\xadfects the con\\xadclu\\xadsions. About em\\xadbed\\xadded agency, the au\\xadthor writes:\\n\\nOne could view the Embed\\xadded Agency work as enu\\xadmer\\xadat\\xading the many log\\xadi\\xadcal pit\\xadfalls one falls into if one takes the “op\\xadti\\xadmizer” con\\xadcept as the start\\xading point for de\\xadsign\\xading in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent sys\\xadtems, rather than “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem” as we pro\\xadpose here.\\n\\nThe cor\\xadrect start\\xading point is “agent”, defined in the way I ges\\xadtured at above. If in\\xadstead we start with “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem” then we throw away the baby with the bath\\xadwa\\xadter, since the cru\\xadcial as\\xadpect of learn\\xading is ig\\xadnored. This is an es\\xadsen\\xadtial prop\\xaderty of the em\\xadbed\\xadded agency prob\\xadlem: ar\\xadguably the en\\xadtire difficulty is about how can we define learn\\xading with\\xadout in\\xadtro\\xadduc\\xading un\\xadphys\\xadi\\xadcal du\\xadal\\xadism (in\\xaddeed, I have re\\xadcently ad\\xaddressed this prob\\xadlem, and “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem” doesn’t seem very helpful there).\\nAbout com\\xadpre\\xadhen\\xadsive AI ser\\xadvices:\\n\\nOur per\\xadspec\\xadtive is that there is a spe\\xadcific class of in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent sys\\xadtems — which we call op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems — that are wor\\xadthy of spe\\xadcial at\\xadten\\xadtion and study due to their po\\xadten\\xadtial to re\\xadshape the world. The set of op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems is smaller than the set of all AI ser\\xadvices, but larger than the set of goal-di\\xadrected agen\\xadtic sys\\xadtems.\\n\\nWhat is an ex\\xadam\\xadple of an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI sys\\xadtem that is not agen\\xadtic? The au\\xadthor doesn’t give such an ex\\xadam\\xadple and in\\xadstead talks about trees, which are not AIs. I agree that the class of dan\\xadger\\xadous sys\\xadtems is sub\\xadstan\\xadtially wider than the class of sys\\xadtems which were ex\\xadplic\\xaditly de\\xadsigned with agency in mind. How\\xadever, this is pre\\xadcisely be\\xadcause agency can arise from such sys\\xadtems even when not ex\\xadplic\\xaditly de\\xadsigned, and more\\xadover this is hard to avoid if the sys\\xadtem is to be pow\\xader\\xadful enough for pivotal acts. This is not be\\xadcause there is some class of “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI sys\\xadtems” which are in\\xadter\\xadme\\xaddi\\xadate be\\xadtween “agen\\xadtic” and “non-agen\\xadtic”.\\nTo sum\\xadma\\xadrize, I agree with and en\\xadcourage the use of tools from dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems the\\xadory to study AI. How\\xadever, one must ac\\xadknowl\\xadedge to cor\\xadrect scope of these tools and what they don’t do. More\\xadover, more work is needed be\\xadfore truly novel con\\xadclu\\xadsions can be ob\\xadtained by these means.\\n\\n\\n↩︎Mo\\xaddulo is\\xadsues with traps which I will not go into atm. \\n\\nWhat links here?Vaniver's comment on 2020 Re\\xadview: The Dis\\xadcus\\xadsion Phase by Vaniver (23 Dec 2021 3:11 UTC; 5 points)Rohin Shah 21 Jun 2020 20:03 UTC LW: 59 AF: 28AFThis is ex\\xadcel\\xadlent, it feels way bet\\xadter as a defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion than past at\\xadtempts :) Thanks in par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar for the aca\\xaddemic style, speci\\xadfi\\xadcally re\\xadlat\\xading it to pre\\xadvi\\xadous work, it made it much more ac\\xadcessible for me.Let’s try to build up some core AI al\\xadign\\xadment ar\\xadgu\\xadments with this defi\\xadni\\xadtion.Task: A task is sim\\xadply an “en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment” along with a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. When\\xadever I talk about a “task” be\\xadlow, as\\xadsume that I mean an “in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading” task, i.e. some\\xadthing like “build a chair”, as op\\xadposed to “have the air molecules be in one of these par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions”.Solv\\xading a task: An ob\\xadject O solves a task T if adding O to T’s en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment trans\\xadforms it into an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem for the T’s tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set.Perfor\\xadmance on the task: If O solves task T, its perfor\\xadmance is quan\\xadtified by how quickly it reaches the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, and how ro\\xadbust it is to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions.Gen\\xader\\xadal\\xadity of in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence: The gen\\xader\\xadal\\xadity of O’s in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence is a func\\xadtion of the num\\xadber and di\\xadver\\xadsity of tasks T that it can solve, as well as its perfor\\xadmance on those tasks.Op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI: A com\\xadputer pro\\xadgram for which there ex\\xadists an in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading task such that the com\\xadputer pro\\xadgram solves that task.This isn’t ex\\xadactly right, as it in\\xadcludes e.g. ac\\xadcount\\xading pro\\xadgrams or video games, which when paired with a hu\\xadman form an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem for cor\\xadrect fi\\xadnan\\xadcials and win\\xadning the game, re\\xadspec\\xadtively. You might be able to fix this by say\\xading that the op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem has to be ro\\xadbust to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions in any hu\\xadman be\\xadhav\\xadior in the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment.AGI: An op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI whose gen\\xader\\xadal\\xadity of in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence is at least as great as that of hu\\xadmans.Ar\\xadgu\\xadment for AI risk: As op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AIs be\\xadcome more and more gen\\xaderal, we will ap\\xadply them to more eco\\xadnom\\xadi\\xadcally use\\xadful tasks T. How\\xadever, they also be\\xadcome more and more ro\\xadbust to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions, pos\\xadsi\\xadbly in\\xadclud\\xading per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions such as “we try to turn off the AI”. As a re\\xadsult, we might even\\xadtu\\xadally have AIs that form strong op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems for some task T that isn’t the one we ac\\xadtu\\xadally wanted, which tends to be bad due to frag\\xadility of value.Deep learn\\xading AGI im\\xadplies mesa op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion: Since deep learn\\xading is so sam\\xadple in\\xadeffi\\xadcient, it can\\xadnot reach hu\\xadman lev\\xadels of perfor\\xadmance if we ap\\xadply deep learn\\xading di\\xadrectly to each pos\\xadsi\\xadble task T. (For ex\\xadam\\xadple, it has to re\\xadlearn how the world works sep\\xada\\xadrately for each task T.) As a re\\xadsult, if we do get AGI pri\\xadmar\\xadily via deep learn\\xading, it must be that we used deep learn\\xading to cre\\xadate a new op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI sys\\xadtem, and that sys\\xadtem was the AGI.Ar\\xadgu\\xadment for mesa op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion: Due to the com\\xadplex\\xadity and noise in the real world, most eco\\xadnom\\xadi\\xadcally use\\xadful tasks re\\xadquire set\\xadting up a ro\\xadbust op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, rather than di\\xadrectly cre\\xadat\\xading the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion state. (See also the im\\xadpor\\xadtance of feed\\xadback for more on this in\\xadtu\\xadition.) It seems likely that hu\\xadmans will find it eas\\xadier to cre\\xadate al\\xadgorithms that then find AGIs that can cre\\xadate these ro\\xadbust op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems, rather than cre\\xadat\\xading an al\\xadgorithm that is di\\xadrectly an AGI.(The pre\\xadvi\\xadous ar\\xadgu\\xadment also ap\\xadplies: this is ba\\xadsi\\xadcally just a gen\\xader\\xadal\\xadiza\\xadtion of the pre\\xadvi\\xadous point to ar\\xadbi\\xadtrary AI sys\\xadtems, in\\xadstead of only deep learn\\xading.)I want to note that un\\xadder this ap\\xadproach the no\\xadtion of “search” and “mesa ob\\xadjec\\xadtive” are less nat\\xadu\\xadral, which I see as a pro of this ap\\xadproach (see also here): the ar\\xadgu\\xadment is that we’ll get a gen\\xaderal in\\xadner op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI, but it doesn’t say much about what task that AI will be op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for (and it could be an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI that is re\\xadtar\\xadgetable by hu\\xadman in\\xadstruc\\xadtions).Outer al\\xadign\\xadment: ??? Seems hard to for\\xadmal\\xadize in this frame\\xadwork. This makes me feel like outer al\\xadign\\xadment is less im\\xadpor\\xadtant as a con\\xadcept. (I also don’t par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlarly like for\\xadmal\\xadiza\\xadtions out\\xadside of this frame\\xadwork.)In\\xadner al\\xadign\\xadment: En\\xadsur\\xading that (con\\xaddi\\xadtional on mesa op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion oc\\xadcur\\xadring) the in\\xadner AGI is al\\xadigned with the op\\xader\\xada\\xadtor /\\u200b user, that is, com\\xadbined with the user it forms an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem for “do\\xading what the user wants”. (Note that this is ex\\xadplic\\xaditly not in\\xadtent al\\xadign\\xadment, as it is hard to for\\xadmal\\xadize in\\xadtent al\\xadign\\xadment in this frame\\xadwork.)In\\xadtent al\\xadign\\xadment: ??? As men\\xadtioned above, it’s hard to for\\xadmal\\xadize in this frame\\xadwork, as in\\xadtent al\\xadign\\xadment re\\xadally does re\\xadquire some no\\xadtion of “mo\\xadti\\xadva\\xadtion”, “goals”, or “try\\xading”, which this frame\\xadwork ex\\xadplic\\xaditly leaves out. I see this as a con of this frame\\xadwork.Ex\\xadpected util\\xadity max\\xadi\\xadmiza\\xadtion: One par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar ar\\xadchi\\xadtec\\xadture that could qual\\xadify as an AGI (if the util\\xadity func\\xadtion is treated as part of the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment, and not part of the AGI). I see the fact that EU max\\xadi\\xadmiza\\xadtion is no longer high\\xadlighted as a pro of this ap\\xadproach.Wire\\xadhead\\xading: Spe\\xadcial case of the ar\\xadgu\\xadment for AI risk with a weird task of “max\\xadi\\xadmize the num\\xadber in this reg\\xadister”. Un\\xadnat\\xadu\\xadral in this fram\\xading of the AI risk prob\\xadlem.

We could say that a robot ca\\xadpa\\xadble of mov\\xading a vase around is a lit\\xadtle bit gen\\xaderal since we can have it solve the tasks of plac\\xading the vase at many differ\\xadent lo\\xadca\\xadtions by in\\xadputting some lat\\xadi\\xadtude/\\u200blon\\xadgi\\xadtude into some ap\\xadpro\\xadpri\\xadate mem\\xadory lo\\xadca\\xadtion. But this means we’re ac\\xadtu\\xadally past\\xading in a differ\\xadent ob\\xadject O for each task T—each of the ob\\xadjects differs in those mem\\xadory lo\\xadca\\xadtions into which we’re past\\xading the lat\\xadi\\xadtude/\\u200blon\\xadgi\\xadtude. It might be helpful to think of a “agent schema” func\\xadtion that maps goals to ob\\xadjects, so we take the goal part of the task, com\\xadpute the ob\\xadject O for that goal, then paste this ob\\xadject into the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment.\\nIt’s also im\\xadpor\\xadtant that O be able to solve the task for a rea\\xadson\\xadably broad range of en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadments.\\n\\nIn\\xadner alignment\\n\\nPer\\xadhaps we could look at it this way: take a sys\\xadtem con\\xadtain\\xading a hu\\xadman that is try\\xading to get some\\xadthing done. This is pre\\xadsum\\xadably an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem as hu\\xadmans of\\xadten ro\\xadbustly move their en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment to\\xadwards some de\\xadsired tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. Then an in\\xadner-al\\xadigned AI is an ob\\xadject O such that adding it to this en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment does not change the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, but does change the speed and/\\u200bor ro\\xadbust\\xadness of con\\xadver\\xadgence to that tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set.\\n\\nIn\\xadtent alignment\\n\\nYup very difficult to say much about in\\xadten\\xadtions us\\xading the pure out\\xadside view ap\\xadproach of this frame\\xadwork. Per\\xadhaps we could say that an in\\xadtent-al\\xadigned AI is an in\\xadner-al\\xadigned AI mod\\xadulo less ro\\xadbust\\xadness. Or per\\xadhaps we could say that an in\\xadtent-al\\xadigned AI is an AI that would achieve the goal in a large set of be\\xadnign en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadments, but might not achieve it in the pres\\xadence of un\\xadlikely mis\\xadtakes, un\\xadlikely en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadmen\\xadtal con\\xaddi\\xadtions, or the pres\\xadence of other pow\\xader\\xadful bas\\xadins of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion.\\nBut this doesn’t re\\xadally get at the spirit of Paul’s idea, which I think is about re\\xadally look\\xading in\\xadside the AI and un\\xadder\\xadstand\\xading its goals.\\nRohin Shah 29 Jun 2020 21:23 UTC LW: 4 AF: 3AFParent+1 to all of this.We’ll pre\\xadsum\\xadably need to give O some in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion about the goal /\\u200b tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set for each task. I was imag\\xadin\\xading that the tasks can come equipped with some speci\\xadfi\\xadca\\xadtion, but some sort of coun\\xadter\\xadfac\\xadtual also makes sense.

The AI steers into con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions which max\\xadi\\xadmize the proxy func\\xadtion. Sim\\xadple prox\\xadies don’t usu\\xadally have tar\\xadget sets which we like, be\\xadcause hu\\xadman value is com\\xadplex. How\\xadever, maybe we just want the AI to ran\\xaddomly se\\xadlect a con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion which satis\\xadfies the proxy, in\\xadstead of find\\xading the max\\xadi\\xadmally-proxy-ness con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion, which may be bad due to ex\\xadtremal Good\\xadhart. Quan\\xadtiliza\\xadtion tries to solve this by ran\\xaddomly se\\xadlect\\xading a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion from some top quan\\xadtile, but this is sen\\xadsi\\xadtive to how world states are in\\xaddi\\xadvi\\xadd\\xadu\\xadated.

(In par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar, in\\xadstead of a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, you want a con\\xadtin\\xadu\\xadous no\\xadtion of good\\xadness, like a util\\xadity func\\xadtion /\\u200b re\\xadward func\\xadtion.)TurnTrout 23 Jun 2020 18:15 UTC LW: 2 AF: 1AFParentI’m say\\xading the tar\\xadget set for non-mild op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion is the set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions which max\\xadi\\xadmize proxy-ness. Just take the argmax. By con\\xadtrast, we might want to sam\\xadple uniformly ran\\xaddomly from the set of satis\\xadfic\\xading con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, which is much larger. (This is as\\xadsum\\xading a fixed ini\\xadtial state)Rohin Shah 23 Jun 2020 18:49 UTC LW: 4 AF: 3AFParentIt sounds like you’re as\\xadsum\\xading that the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set is built into the AI sys\\xadtem. Ac\\xadcord\\xading to me, a ma\\xadjor point of this post /\\u200b frame\\xadwork is to avoid that as\\xadsump\\xadtion al\\xadto\\xadgether, and only de\\xadscribe prob\\xadlems in terms of the ac\\xadtual ob\\xadserved sys\\xadtem be\\xadhav\\xadior.(This is why within this frame\\xadwork I couldn’t for\\xadmal\\xadize outer al\\xadign\\xadment, and why wire\\xadhead\\xading and the search /\\u200b mesa-ob\\xadjec\\xadtive split is un\\xadnat\\xadu\\xadral.)TurnTrout 23 Jun 2020 19:48 UTC LW: 4 AF: 3AFParentI see the ten\\xadsion you’re point\\xading at. I think I had in mind some\\xadthing like “an AI is re\\xadli\\xadably op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading util\\xadity func\\xadtion u over the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space (but not nec\\xades\\xadsar\\xadily over uni\\xadverse-his\\xadto\\xadries!) if it re\\xadli\\xadably moves into high-rated con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions”, and you could draw differ\\xadent ep\\xadsilon-neigh\\xadbor\\xadhoods of op\\xadti\\xadmal\\xadity in con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space. It seems like you should be able to talk about dog-max\\xadi\\xadmiz\\xaders with\\xadout re\\xadquiring that the agent ro\\xadbustly end up in the max\\xadi\\xadmum-dog con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions (and not in max-minus-one-dog con\\xadfigs). I’m still con\\xadfused about parts of this.ESRogs 30 Jun 2020 23:59 UTC LW: 4 AF: 3AFParentDeep learn\\xading AGI im\\xadplies mesa op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion: Since deep learn\\xading is so sam\\xadple in\\xadeffi\\xadcient, it can\\xadnot reach hu\\xadman lev\\xadels of perfor\\xadmance if we ap\\xadply deep learn\\xading di\\xadrectly to each pos\\xadsi\\xadble task T. (For ex\\xadam\\xadple, it has to re\\xadlearn how the world works sep\\xada\\xadrately for each task T.) As a re\\xadsult, if we do get AGI pri\\xadmar\\xadily via deep learn\\xading, it must be that we used deep learn\\xading to cre\\xadate a new op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI sys\\xadtem, and that sys\\xadtem was the AGI.I don’t quite un\\xadder\\xadstand what this is say\\xading.Sup\\xadpose we train a gi\\xadant deep learn\\xading model via self-su\\xadper\\xadvised learn\\xading on a ton of real-world data (like GPT-N, but w/\\u200b other sen\\xadsory modal\\xadities be\\xadsides text), and then we build a sec\\xadond sys\\xadtem de\\xadsigned to provide a nice in\\xadter\\xadface to the gi\\xadant model.We’d give task speci\\xadfi\\xadca\\xadtions to the in\\xadter\\xadface, and it would have some smarts about how to con\\xadsult the model to figure out what to do. (The in\\xadter\\xadface might also be learned, via re\\xadin\\xadforce\\xadment or su\\xadper\\xadvised learn\\xading, or it might be hand-coded.)It seems plau\\xadsi\\xadble to me that a sys\\xadtem com\\xadpris\\xading these two pieces, the model and the in\\xadter\\xadface, could be an AGI ac\\xadcord\\xading to the defi\\xadni\\xadtion here, in that when com\\xadbined with a very wide va\\xadri\\xadety of en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadments (in\\xadclud\\xading the task speci\\xadfi\\xadca\\xadtion in the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment), it could perform at least as well as a hu\\xadman.And since most of the smarts seem like they’d be in the model rather than the in\\xadter\\xadface, I’d count it as get\\xadting AGI “pri\\xadmar\\xadily via deep learn\\xading”, even if the in\\xadter\\xadface was hand-coded.But it’s not clear to me whether that would count as us\\xading deep learn\\xading to “cre\\xadate a new op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI sys\\xadtem”, which is it\\xadself the AGI. The whole sys\\xadtem is an Op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI, ac\\xadcord\\xading to the defi\\xadni\\xadtion given above, but nei\\xadther of the two parts is by it\\xadself, and it doesn’t seem to have the fla\\xadvor of mesa-op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, as I un\\xadder\\xadstand it. So it seems like a con\\xadtra\\xaddic\\xadtion to the quoted claim.Have I mi\\xads\\xadun\\xadder\\xadstood what you’re say\\xading here, or do you dis\\xadagree with the char\\xadac\\xadter\\xadi\\xadza\\xadtion I gave of the hy\\xadpo\\xadthet\\xadi\\xadcal model + in\\xadter\\xadface sys\\xadtem?

I men\\xadtioned this a bit later in the com\\xadment:I want to note that un\\xadder this ap\\xadproach the no\\xadtion of “search” and “mesa ob\\xadjec\\xadtive” are less nat\\xadu\\xadral, which I see as a pro of this ap\\xadproach [...]: the ar\\xadgu\\xadment is that we’ll get a gen\\xaderal in\\xadner op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI, but it doesn’t say much about what task that AI will be op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for (and it could be an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading AI that is re\\xadtar\\xadgetable by hu\\xadman in\\xadstruc\\xadtions).matthewp 31 Mar 2022 13:09 UTC 1 pointParentThanks for the ad\\xaddi\\xadtions here.

Here are her com\\xadments, which she asked me to share:This es\\xadsay pro\\xadposes a very in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion as the man\\xadi\\xadfes\\xadta\\xadtion of a par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar be\\xadhav\\xadior of a closed, phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem. I haven’t finished think\\xading this over, but I sus\\xadpect it will be (as is sug\\xadgested in the es\\xadsay) a use\\xadful con\\xadstruct. The rea\\xadson\\xading lead\\xading to the defi\\xadni\\xadtion is clearly laid out (thank you!), with ex\\xadam\\xadples that are very use\\xadful in un\\xadder\\xadstand\\xading the con\\xadcept. The down\\xadside of be\\xading clearly laid out, how\\xadever, is that it makes cri\\xadtique eas\\xadier. I have a few thoughts about the rea\\xadson\\xading in the es\\xadsay.The first thing I will note is that the es\\xadsay gives three defi\\xadni\\xadtions for an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem. Th\\xadese defi\\xadni\\xadtions are close, but not ex\\xadactly equiv\\xada\\xadlent. The nu\\xadances can be im\\xadpor\\xadtant. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, that the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set and the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion can\\xadnot be equal is ob\\xadvi\\xadous; that is made ex\\xadplicit in defi\\xadni\\xadtion 3, but only im\\xadplied in defi\\xadni\\xadtions 1 and 2. A big\\xadger is\\xadsue is that there are no crite\\xadria or ra\\xadtio\\xadnale for their ex\\xadtent and rel\\xada\\xadtive size. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, the es\\xadsay offers two rea\\xadsons why the poster\\xadchild of non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xaders—the bot\\xadtle with a cap—is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem; they both arise from the rather ar\\xadbi\\xadtrary defi\\xadni\\xadtion of the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion as equal to the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. I see no nec\\xades\\xadsary rea\\xadson why the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion couldn’t be defined as the set of all con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions of wa\\xadter molecules both in\\xadside and out\\xadside the bot\\xadtle. That way, the defi\\xadni\\xadtional re\\xadquire\\xadment of a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set smaller than the ba\\xadsis of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion is met. The im\\xadpor\\xadtant point is: will wa\\xadter molecules in this new, larger basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion tend to the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set? Let’s sup\\xadpose that capped bot\\xadtle is in a sealed room (not nec\\xades\\xadsary but eas\\xadier to think about), and that the cap is made of a spe\\xadcial ma\\xadte\\xadrial that al\\xadlows wa\\xadter molecules to pass through it in only one di\\xadrec\\xadtion: from out\\xadside the bot\\xadtle to in\\xadside. The wa\\xadter molecules in\\xadside the bot\\xadtle stay in\\xadside the bot\\xadtle, as for any cap. The wa\\xadter molecules in\\xadside the room, but out\\xadside the bot\\xadtle, are zoom\\xading about (ther\\xadmo\\xaddy\\xadnamic en\\xadergy), bounc\\xading off the walls, each other, and the bot\\xadtle. Although it will take some time, sooner or later all the molecules out\\xadside the bot\\xadtle will hit the bot\\xadtle cap, go through, and be trapped in the bot\\xadtle. Voila! Origi\\xadnally, the bot\\xadtle-with-a-cap sys\\xadtem was a non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem by defi\\xadni\\xadtion; the bot\\xadtle cap type was ir\\xadrele\\xadvant and could have been the rather spe\\xadcial one I de\\xadscribed. Sim\\xadply by chang\\xading the defi\\xadni\\xadtion of the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, we could turn it into an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem. Fur\\xadther, the origi\\xadnal, “non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading” sys\\xadtem (with the origi\\xadnal defi\\xadni\\xadtions of the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion and tar\\xadget set) would have be\\xadhaved ex\\xadactly the same as my op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem. On the other hand, chang\\xading the bot\\xadtle cap from our spe\\xadcial one to a reg\\xadu\\xadlar cap will change the sys\\xadtem into a non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, re\\xadgard\\xadless of the defi\\xadni\\xadtions of the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion and the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. Per\\xadhaps, we should in\\xadsist that a prop\\xaderly formed sys\\xadtem de\\xadscrip\\xadtion has a basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion that is larger than the tar\\xadget set, and count on the sys\\xadtem be\\xadhav\\xadior to make the op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading/\\u200bnon-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading dis\\xadtinc\\xadtion.Defi\\xadni\\xadtions 1 and 2 both con\\xadtain the phrase “a small set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions” which im\\xadplies that the tar\\xadget set << than the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion. This is a prob\\xadlem for the no\\xadtion of the uni\\xadverse as a sys\\xadtem with max\\xadi\\xadmum en\\xadtropy as the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set be\\xadcause the tar\\xadget set is most of the pos\\xadsi\\xadble con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions. For this rea\\xadson, the es\\xadsay’s au\\xadthor con\\xadcludes that uni\\xadverse-with-en\\xadtropy sys\\xadtem is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, or at best, a weak one. Stars, galax\\xadies, black holes – there are strong forces that pull mat\\xadter into these struc\\xadtures. I would say that any sys\\xadtem that has suc\\xadceeded in get\\xadting nearly ev\\xadery\\xadthing within the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion into the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion is a strong op\\xadti\\xadmizer! Re\\xadgard\\xadless of the way we chose to think about strong or weak, the uni\\xadverse is a sys\\xadtem that tends to a set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions smaller than the set of pos\\xadsi\\xadble con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions (the oc\\xadca\\xadsional house-build\\xading pro\\xadject for ex\\xadam\\xadple!). Per\\xadson\\xadally, I see no value in a defi\\xadni\\xadtional limi\\xadta\\xadtion. The be\\xadhav\\xadior of the sys\\xadtem (tend\\xading to\\xadward a smaller set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions out of a larger set) should gov\\xadern the defi\\xadni\\xadtion of an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, re\\xadgard\\xadless of rel\\xada\\xadtive sizes of the sets.Between the uni\\xadverse-with-en\\xadtropy and bot\\xadtle-with-a-cap sys\\xadtems, I ques\\xadtion the util\\xadity of the “all con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions >= basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion >> tar\\xadget set con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion” struc\\xadture in the defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems. I be\\xadlieve it is worth think\\xading about what the nec\\xades\\xadsary re\\xadla\\xadtion\\xadships among these con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions are, and how they are cho\\xadsen.The ex\\xadam\\xadple of the billiards sys\\xadtem raised an\\xadother (to me) in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading ques\\xadtion. The es\\xadsay did not offer a sys\\xadtem de\\xadscrip\\xadtion but says “Con\\xadsider a billiard table with some billiard balls that are cur\\xadrently bounc\\xading around in mo\\xadtion. Left alone, the balls will even\\xadtu\\xadally come to rest in some con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion…. If we reach in while the billiard balls are bounc\\xading around and move one of the balls that is in mo\\xadtion, the sys\\xadtem will now come to rest in a differ\\xadent con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion. There\\xadfore this is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, be\\xadcause there is no set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions to\\xadwards which the sys\\xadtem evolves de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions.” This ex\\xadam\\xadple has some odd fea\\xadtures. Fric\\xadtion be\\xadtween the balls and the table sur\\xadface, along with the loss of en\\xadergy dur\\xading non-elas\\xadtic col\\xadli\\xadsions, cause the balls to slow down and stop. The minu\\xadtia of their trav\\xadels de\\xadter\\xadmines where they stop. The fi\\xadnal ar\\xadrange\\xadment is un\\xadpre\\xaddictable (ok, it could be mod\\xadeled given com\\xadplete in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion, but let’s skip that as beside the point), and any ar\\xadrange\\xadment is as likely as an\\xadother. This sug\\xadgests that the billiards sys\\xadtem is a non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem even with\\xadout the pro\\xadposed per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion of mov\\xading the balls around while the balls are in mo\\xadtion. Looked at an\\xadother way, billiards sys\\xadtem does tend to a cer\\xadtain tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, while fric\\xadtion and the non-elas\\xadtic\\xadity of the col\\xadli\\xadsions are per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions. If we make the sur\\xadface fric\\xadtion\\xadless and the col\\xadli\\xadsions perfectly elas\\xadtic, the balls will bounce around the table with\\xadout stop\\xadping. Much like the wa\\xadter molecules in the bot\\xadtle-with-a-cap ex\\xadam\\xadple, each will even\\xadtu\\xadally fall into one pocket or an\\xadother dur\\xading its trav\\xadels. Once in the pocket, the ball can\\xadnot get out, and thus even\\xadtu\\xadally all will end up in the pock\\xadets. So, this sys\\xadtem tends to a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set of all balls in pock\\xadets. Ad\\xadding back in the per\\xadturb\\xading fric\\xadtion and en\\xadergy loss does not mean that this sys\\xadtem is not tend\\xading to the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. Reach\\xading in and mov\\xading a ball to a differ\\xadent point, or even redi\\xadrect\\xading any ball head\\xading for a pocket, will not keep this sys\\xadtem from tend\\xading to\\xadwards the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion. It seems as though the billiards sys\\xadtem was an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem all along! The larger point is that it seems, by defi\\xadni\\xadtion, an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem even if there are a set of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions that pre\\xadvent it from ever reach\\xading the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion! “Tend\\xading to\\xadward”, not “reach\\xading”, a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set is in all three defi\\xadni\\xadtions. It is worth think\\xading about an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem that never ac\\xadtu\\xadally op\\xadti\\xadmizes. This may have some bear\\xading on the AGI ques\\xadtion.[And for you read\\xaders who, like me, would say, whoa—it is pos\\xadsi\\xadble that the balls will en\\xadter some re\\xadpeat\\xading pat\\xadtern of mo\\xadtion where some do not en\\xadter pock\\xadets. Maybe we need a robot to move the balls around ran\\xaddomly if they seem stuck, just like the ball-in-valley+robot sys\\xadtem where the robot moves the ball over bar\\xadri\\xaders. I main\\xadtain that the point is the same.]The satel\\xadlite sys\\xadtem illus\\xadtrates (per\\xadhaps an ob\\xadvi\\xadous point) that the defi\\xadni\\xadtion of the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set can change a sin\\xadgle sys\\xadtem from op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading and to non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading. What is a lit\\xadtle more sub\\xadtle is that the defi\\xadni\\xadtion of the sys\\xadtem bound\\xadaries is es\\xadsen\\xadtial to the char\\xadac\\xadter\\xadi\\xadza\\xadtion of the sys\\xadtem as op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading or non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading, even if the be\\xadhav\\xadior of the sys\\xadtem is the same un\\xadder both defi\\xadni\\xadtions. In par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar, what we con\\xadsider to be part of the sys\\xadtem and what is con\\xadsid\\xadered to be a per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion can flip a sys\\xadtem be\\xadtween char\\xadac\\xadter\\xadi\\xadza\\xadtions. [This lat\\xadter point is illus\\xadtrated by the billiards sys\\xadtem as well, as I will ex\\xadplain be\\xadlow.] The es\\xadsay says that a satel\\xadlite in or\\xadbit is a non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem be\\xadcause if its po\\xadsi\\xadtion or ve\\xadloc\\xadity is per\\xadturbed, it has no ten\\xaddency to re\\xadturn to its origi\\xadnal or\\xadbit; that is, the au\\xadthor defines the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion as a par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar or\\xadbit. With re\\xadspect to an\\xadother tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion that may be de\\xadscribed as “a scorched pile of junk on the sur\\xadface of the Earth”, a satel\\xadlite in or\\xadbit is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem ex\\xadactly like a ball in a valley. As soon as the launch rocket stops firing, a satel\\xadlite starts fal\\xadling to the cen\\xadter of the earth be\\xadcause at\\xadmo\\xadspheric drag and so\\xadlar ra\\xaddi\\xada\\xadtion pres\\xadsure con\\xadtin\\xadu\\xadously de\\xadcrease the com\\xadpo\\xadnent of the satel\\xadlite’s ve\\xadloc\\xadity per\\xadpen\\xaddicu\\xadlar to the force of grav\\xadity. So, un\\xadless a per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion is big enough to send it out of or\\xadbit al\\xadto\\xadgether, a satel\\xadlite tends to\\xadwards a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion of junk lo\\xadcated on Earth’s sur\\xadface.Since a par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar or\\xadbit is usu\\xadally the de\\xadsired tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion (!), many satel\\xadlites in\\xadcor\\xadpo\\xadrate a rocket sys\\xadtem to force them to stay in a cho\\xadsen or\\xadbit. If a rocket sys\\xadtem is in\\xadcluded in the sys\\xadtem defi\\xadni\\xadtion, then the satel\\xadlite is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem rel\\xada\\xadtive to the de\\xadsired or\\xadbit. What is a lit\\xadtle more in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading, with re\\xadspect to the junk-on-the-Earth tar\\xadget set, drag and so\\xadlar pres\\xadsure are the part of the op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem; an or\\xadbit cor\\xadrec\\xadtion sys\\xadtem is a per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion. If the tar\\xadget set is the par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar or\\xadbit the satel\\xadlite started in, these defi\\xadni\\xadtions swap. This ob\\xadser\\xadva\\xadtion has bear\\xading on the billiards sys\\xadtem ex\\xadam\\xadple. If we in\\xadclude drag and non-elas\\xadtic col\\xadli\\xadsions as part of the billiards sys\\xadtem, then the sys\\xadtem is non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading. If we see them as per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions out\\xadside the sys\\xadtem, then the billiards sys\\xadtem is op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading. I find this flex\\xadi\\xadbil\\xadity as a lit\\xadtle cu\\xadri\\xadous, al\\xadthough I haven’t com\\xadpletely thought through the im\\xadpli\\xadca\\xadtions.A com\\xadpletely differ\\xadent sort of ques\\xadtion is sug\\xadgested by the sec\\xadtion on Drexler. There the es\\xadsay sets out a hi\\xader\\xadar\\xadchy of all AI sys\\xadtems, op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems, and goal-di\\xadrected agent sys\\xadtems. This makes sense with re\\xadspect to AI sys\\xadtems, but I do not see how op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems, as defined, can be wholly con\\xadtained within the cat\\xade\\xadgory of AI sys\\xadtems, un\\xadless you define AI sys\\xadtems pretty broadly. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, I think that pretty much any con\\xadtrol sys\\xadtem is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem by the defi\\xadni\\xadtion in the es\\xadsay. If we ac\\xadcept this defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, and hold that all op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems are a sub\\xadset of AI sys\\xadtems, do we have to ac\\xadcept our ther\\xadmostats as AI sys\\xadtems? What about the pro\\xadgram that de\\xadter\\xadmined the square root of 2? Is that AI? Is this an is\\xadsue for this defi\\xadni\\xadtion, or does its broad\\xadness mat\\xadter in an AI con\\xadtext?And a nit\\xadpick: The first ex\\xadam\\xadple of an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem offered in the es\\xadsay is a pro\\xadgram calcu\\xadlat\\xading the square root of 2. It meets the defi\\xadni\\xadtion of an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, but it seems to con\\xadtra\\xaddict the ear\\xadlier as\\xadser\\xadtion that “… op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems are not some\\xadthing that are de\\xadsigned but are dis\\xadcov\\xadered.” The al\\xadgorithm and the pro\\xadgram were both de\\xadsigned. I’m not sure why this point is nec\\xades\\xadsary. Either I do not un\\xadder\\xadstand some\\xadthing fun\\xadda\\xadmen\\xadtal, or the only pur\\xadpose of the state\\xadment of dis\\xadcov\\xadery is to give peo\\xadple like me some\\xadthing to ar\\xadgue about!In sum\\xadmary, the defi\\xadni\\xadtion in the es\\xadsay sug\\xadgests a few ques\\xadtions that could have a bear\\xading on its ap\\xadpli\\xadca\\xadtion:How do we choose the ba\\xadsis of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion rel\\xada\\xadtive to the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, if our choice can change the sta\\xadtus of the sys\\xadtem from op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading to non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading and vice versa?Is it an is\\xadsue that an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem may never ac\\xadtu\\xadally op\\xadti\\xadmize? How do we choose what is part of the sys\\xadtem ver\\xadsus a per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion out\\xadside the sys\\xadtem when our choice changes the sta\\xadtus of the sys\\xadtem as op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading or non-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading?All con\\xadtrol sys\\xadtems are op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems by the defi\\xadni\\xadtion, but are all con\\xadtrol sys\\xadtems AI sys\\xadtems? Does it mat\\xadter? If it does mat\\xadter, how do we tell the differ\\xadence?For any of these, how do they af\\xadfect our think\\xading for AI?Fi\\xadnally, it might be bet\\xadter to have one, con\\xadsis\\xadtent defi\\xadni\\xadtion that cov\\xaders all the pos\\xadsi\\xadbil\\xadities, in\\xadclud\\xading (in my opinion) that per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions may be con\\xadfined to cer\\xadtain di\\xadmen\\xadsions.Aryeh Englander 2 Jul 2020 17:44 UTC LW: 4 AF: 2AFParentThis was ac\\xadtu\\xadally part of a con\\xadver\\xadsa\\xadtion I was hav\\xading with this col\\xadleague re\\xadgard\\xading whether or not evolu\\xadtion can be viewed as an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion pro\\xadcess. Here are some fol\\xadlow-up com\\xadments to what she wrote above re\\xadlated to the evolu\\xadtion an\\xadgle:We could define the nat\\xadu\\xadral se\\xadlec\\xadtion sys\\xadtem as:All con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions = all ar\\xadrange\\xadments of mat\\xadter on a planet (both ar\\xadrange\\xadments that are liv\\xading and those that are non-liv\\xading) Ba\\xadsis of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion = all ar\\xadrange\\xadments of mat\\xadter on a planet that meet the defi\\xadni\\xadtion of a liv\\xading thingTar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set = all ar\\xadrange\\xadments of liv\\xading things where the type and num\\xadber of liv\\xading things re\\xadmains ap\\xadprox\\xadi\\xadmately sta\\xadble.I think that this sys\\xadtem meets the defi\\xadni\\xadtion of an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem given in the Ground for Op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion es\\xadsay. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, preda\\xadtor and prey co-evolve to be about “equal” in sur\\xadvival abil\\xadity. If a preda\\xadtor be\\xadcome so much bet\\xadter than its prey that it eats them all, the preda\\xadtor will die out along with its prey; the re\\xadmain\\xading an\\xadi\\xadmals will be in bal\\xadance. I think this works for cli\\xadmate per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions, etc. too.HOWEVER, it should be clear that there are nu\\xadmer\\xadous ways in which this can hap\\xadpen – like the ball on bumpy sur\\xadface with a lot of con\\xadvex “valleys” (lo\\xadcal min\\xadima), there is not just one way that liv\\xading things can be in bal\\xadance. So, to say that “nat\\xadu\\xadral se\\xadlec\\xadtion op\\xadti\\xadmized for in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence” is quite not right – it just fell into a “valley” where in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence hap\\xadpened. FURTHER, it’s not clear that we have reached the lo\\xadcal min\\xadi\\xadmum! Hu\\xadmans may be that preda\\xadtor that is go\\xading to fall “prey” to its own suc\\xadcess. If that hap\\xadpened (and any in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgent an\\xadi\\xadmals re\\xadmain at all), I guess we could say that nat\\xadu\\xadral se\\xadlec\\xadtion op\\xadti\\xadmized for less-than-hu\\xadman in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence!Fur\\xadther, this defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion has no con\\xadno\\xadta\\xadtion of “best” or even bet\\xadter – just equal to a defined set. The word “op\\xadti\\xadmize” is loaded. And its use in con\\xadnec\\xadtion with nat\\xadu\\xadral se\\xadlec\\xadtion has led to a lot of trou\\xadble in terms of hu\\xadman races, and hu\\xadmans v. an\\xadi\\xadmal rights.Fi\\xadnally, in the es\\xadsay’s defi\\xadni\\xadtion, there is no im\\xadper\\xada\\xadtive that the tar\\xadget set be reached. As long as the set of liv\\xading things is “tend\\xading” to\\xadward in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence, then the sys\\xadtem is op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading. So even if nat\\xadu\\xadral se\\xadlec\\xadtion was op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for in\\xadtel\\xadli\\xadgence there is no guaran\\xadtee that it will be achieved (in its high\\xadest man\\xadi\\xadfes\\xadta\\xadtion). Like a billiards sys\\xadtem where the table is slick (but not fric\\xadtion\\xadless) and the col\\xadli\\xadsions are close to elas\\xadtic, the balls may come to rest with some of the balls out\\xadside the pock\\xadets. The rea\\xadson I think this is im\\xadpor\\xadtant for AI re\\xadsearch, es\\xadpe\\xadcially AGI and ASI, is per\\xadhaps we should be look\\xading for those per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions to pre\\xadvent us from ever reach\\xading what we may think of as the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion, de\\xadspite our best efforts. johnswentworth 22 Jun 2020 22:05 UTC LW: 24 AF: 14AFMy biggest ob\\xadjec\\xadtion to this defi\\xadni\\xadtion is that it in\\xadher\\xadently re\\xadquires time. At a bare min\\xadi\\xadmum, there needs to be an “ini\\xadtial state” and a “fi\\xadnal state” within the same state space, so we can talk about the sys\\xadtem go\\xading from out\\xadside the tar\\xadget set to in\\xadside the tar\\xadget set.One class of cases which definitely seem like op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion but do not satisfy this prop\\xaderty at all: one-shot non-iter\\xada\\xadtive op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion.

I’d like to write a whole post about it. Here are my thoughts:\\nFirst, just as a fun fact, not that it’s ac\\xadtu\\xadally ex\\xadtremely rare to see any non-iter\\xada\\xadtive op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion in prac\\xadti\\xadcal us\\xadage. When we solve lin\\xadear equa\\xadtions, we could use gaus\\xadsian elimi\\xadna\\xadtion but it’s so un\\xadsta\\xadble that in prac\\xadtice we use, most likely, the SVD, which is iter\\xada\\xadtive. When we solve a sys\\xadtem of polyno\\xadmial equa\\xadtion we could use some\\xadthing like a Grob\\xadner ba\\xadsis or the re\\xadsul\\xadtant, but it’s so un\\xadsta\\xadble that in prac\\xadtice we some\\xadthing like a com\\xadpan\\xadion ma\\xadtrix method, which comes down to an eigen\\xadvalue de\\xadcom\\xadpo\\xadsi\\xadtion, which is again iter\\xada\\xadtive.Con\\xadsider find\\xading the roots of a sim\\xadple quadratic equa\\xadtion (ie solv\\xading a cu\\xadbic op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem). We can use the quadratic equa\\xadtion to do this. But ul\\xadti\\xadmately this comes down to com\\xadput\\xading a square root, which is typ\\xadi\\xadcally (though not nec\\xades\\xadsar\\xadily) solved with an iter\\xada\\xadtive method.That these meth\\xadods (for solv\\xading lin\\xadear sys\\xadtems, polyno\\xadmial sys\\xadtems, and quadratic equa\\xadtions) have at their heart an iter\\xada\\xadtive op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion al\\xadgorithm is not ac\\xadci\\xadden\\xadtal. The iter\\xada\\xadtive meth\\xadods in\\xadvolved are not some small or sideline part of what’s go\\xading on. In fact when you solve a sys\\xadtem of polyno\\xadmial equa\\xadtions us\\xading a com\\xadpan\\xadion ma\\xadtrix, you spend a lot of en\\xadergy re\\xadar\\xadrang\\xading the sys\\xadtem into a form where it can be solved via an eigen\\xadvalue de\\xadcom\\xadpo\\xadsi\\xadtion, and then the eigen\\xadvalue de\\xadcom\\xadpo\\xadsi\\xadtion it\\xadself is very much op\\xader\\xadat\\xading on the full prob\\xadlem. It’s not some unim\\xadpor\\xadtant side op\\xader\\xada\\xadtion. I find this fas\\xadci\\xadnat\\xading.Nev\\xader\\xadthe\\xadless it is pos\\xadsi\\xadble to solve lin\\xadear sys\\xadtems, polyno\\xadmial sys\\xadtems etc with non-iter\\xada\\xadtive meth\\xadods.Th\\xadese meth\\xadods are definitely con\\xadsid\\xadered “op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion” by any nor\\xadmal use of that term. So in this way my defi\\xadni\\xadtion doesn’t quite line up with the com\\xadmon lan\\xadguage use of the word “op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion”.But these non-iter\\xada\\xadtive meth\\xadods ac\\xadtu\\xadally do not have the core prop\\xaderty that I de\\xadscribed in the square-root-of-two ex\\xadam\\xadple. If I reach in and flip a bit while a Guas\\xadsian elimi\\xadna\\xadtion is run\\xadning, the al\\xadgorithm does not in any sense re\\xadcover. Since the al\\xadgorithm is just perform\\xading a lin\\xadear se\\xadquence of steps, the er\\xadror just grows and grows as the com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtion un\\xadfolds. This is the op\\xadpo\\xadsite of what hap\\xadpens if I reach in and flip a bit while an SVD is be\\xading com\\xadputed: in this case the er\\xadror will be driven back to zero by the iter\\xada\\xadtive op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion al\\xadgorithm.You might say that my fo\\xadcus on er\\xadror-cor\\xadrec\\xadtion sim\\xadply doesn’t cap\\xadture the com\\xadmon lan\\xadguage use of the term op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, as demon\\xadstrated by the fact that non-iter\\xada\\xadtive op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion al\\xadgorithms do not have this er\\xadror-cor\\xadrect\\xading prop\\xaderty. You would be cor\\xadrect!But per\\xadhaps my real re\\xadsponse is that fun\\xadda\\xadmen\\xadtally I’m in\\xadter\\xadested in these pro\\xadcesses that some\\xadwhat mys\\xadte\\xadri\\xadously drive the state of the world to\\xadwards a tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion, and keep do\\xading so de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions. I think these are cen\\xadtral to what AI and agency are. The term “op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem” might not be quite right, but it seems close enough to be com\\xadpel\\xadling.\\nThanks for the ques\\xadtion—I clar\\xadified my own think\\xading while writ\\xading up this re\\xadsponse.\\njohnswentworth 29 Jun 2020 4:50 UTC LW: 4 AF: 2AFParentAnother big thing to note in ex\\xadam\\xadples like e.g. iter\\xada\\xadtively com\\xadput\\xading a square root for the quadratic for\\xadmula or iter\\xada\\xadtively com\\xadput\\xading eigen\\xadval\\xadues to solve a ma\\xadtrix: the op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlems we’re solv\\xading are sub\\xadprob\\xadlems, not the origi\\xadnal full prob\\xadlem. Th\\xadese cru\\xadcially differ from most of the ex\\xadam\\xadples in the OP in that the sys\\xadtem’s ob\\xadjec\\xadtive func\\xadtion (in your sense) does not match the ob\\xadjec\\xadtive func\\xadtion (in the usual in\\xadtu\\xaditive sense). They’re iter\\xada\\xadtively op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading a sub\\xadprob\\xadlem’s ob\\xadjec\\xadtive, not the “full” prob\\xadlem’s ob\\xadjec\\xadtive.That’s po\\xadten\\xadtially an is\\xadsue for think\\xading about e.g. AI as an op\\xadti\\xadmizer: if it’s us\\xading iter\\xada\\xadtive op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion on sub\\xadprob\\xadlems, but us\\xading those re\\xadsults to perform some higher-level op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion in a non-iter\\xada\\xadtive man\\xadner, then al\\xadign\\xading the sobprob\\xadlem-op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xaders may not be syn\\xadony\\xadmous with al\\xadign\\xading the full AI. In\\xaddeed, I think a lot of rea\\xadson\\xading works very much like this: we de\\xadcom\\xadpose a high-di\\xadmen\\xadsional prob\\xadlem into cou\\xadpled low-di\\xadmen\\xadsional sub\\xadprob\\xadlems (i.e. “gears”), then ap\\xadply iter\\xada\\xadtive op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xaders to the sub\\xadprob\\xadlems. That’s ex\\xadactly how eigen\\xadvalue al\\xadgorithms work, for in\\xadstance: we de\\xadcom\\xadpose the full prob\\xadlem into a se\\xadries of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion sub\\xadprob\\xadlems in nar\\xadrower and nar\\xadrower sub\\xadspaces, while the “high-level” part of the al\\xadgorithm (i.e. out\\xadside the sub\\xadprob\\xadlems) doesn’t look like iter\\xada\\xadtive op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion.johnswentworth 30 Jun 2020 17:04 UTC LW: 3 AF: 2AFParentFas\\xadci\\xadnat\\xading—but why is this an ob\\xadjec\\xadtion? Is it just the in\\xadel\\xade\\xadgance of not be\\xading able to look at a sin\\xadgle time slice and an\\xadswer the ques\\xadtion of whether op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion is hap\\xadpen\\xading?No, the is\\xadsue is that the usual defi\\xadni\\xadtion of an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem (e.g. maxx f(x)) has no built-in no\\xadtion of time, and the in\\xadtu\\xaditive no\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion (e.g. “the sys\\xadtem makes Y big”) has no built-in no\\xadtion of time (or at least lin\\xadear time). It’s this re\\xadally fun\\xadda\\xadmen\\xadtal thing that isn’t pre\\xadsent in the “origi\\xadnal prob\\xadlem”, so to speak; it would be very sur\\xadpris\\xading and in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading if time had to be in\\xadvolved when it’s not pre\\xadsent from the start.

There, any path from a leaf to the root could be con\\xadsid\\xadered “time” (but the whole set of nodes at the “same level” can’t be con\\xadsid\\xadered a time-slice, be\\xadcause we don’t have a mean\\xadingful way to com\\xadpare whole sets of val\\xadues; we could in\\xadvent one, but it wouldn’t ac\\xadtu\\xadally re\\xadflect the tree struc\\xadture).The ex\\xadam\\xadple from the ear\\xadlier com\\xadment: a one-shot non-iter\\xada\\xadtive optimizerA dis\\xadtributed op\\xadti\\xadmizer: the sys\\xadtem fans out, tests a whole bunch of pos\\xadsi\\xadble choices in par\\xadallel, then se\\xadlects the best of those.Var\\xadi\\xadous fla\\xadvors of con\\xadstraint prop\\xada\\xadga\\xadtion, e.g. the sim\\xadplex al\\xadgorithm (and mar\\xadkets more gen\\xader\\xadally)Davidmanheim 24 Jun 2020 17:15 UTC LW: 4 AF: 2AFParentI think this is cov\\xadered in my view of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion via se\\xadlec\\xadtion, where “di\\xadrect solu\\xadtion” is the third op\\xadtion.

What’s the state space (in which both the start and end state of the op\\xadti\\xadmizer live), what’s the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion (i.e. set of al\\xadlowed ini\\xadtial con\\xaddi\\xadtions), and what’s the tar\\xadget re\\xadgion within the state space?

The ini\\xadtial state is those reg\\xadisters con\\xadtain\\xading ar\\xadbi\\xadtrary data to be over\\xadwrit\\xadten. It’s not par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlarly in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading as op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlems go (not a very large basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion) but it fulfills the ba\\xadsic crite\\xadria.The unique thing about your ex\\xadam\\xadple is that it solves once and then it is done (rel\\xada\\xadtive to the ex\\xadam\\xadples in the post), so it ceases to be an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem once it finishes com\\xadput\\xading the solu\\xadtion to your con\\xadvex func\\xadtion.With a slight mod\\xadifi\\xadca\\xadtion, you could be re\\xadpeat\\xading this al\\xadgorithm in a loop so it con\\xadstantly re\\xadcalcu\\xadlates a new func\\xadtion. Now the ini\\xadtial state can be some value in the re\\xadsult and in\\xadput reg\\xadisters, and the tar\\xadget re\\xadgion is the set of in\\xadput equa\\xadtions and ap\\xadpro\\xadpri\\xadate solu\\xadtion in the out\\xadput reg\\xadisters. It widens the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion to both the in\\xadput and out\\xadput reg\\xadisters rather than just the out\\xadput.johnswentworth 24 Jun 2020 15:34 UTC 2 pointsParentOk, two prob\\xadlems with this:There’s no rea\\xadson why that tar\\xadget set would be smaller than the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion. Given one such op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion prob\\xadlem, there are no ob\\xadvi\\xadous per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions we could make which would leave the re\\xadsult in the tar\\xadget re\\xadgion.The tar\\xadget re\\xadgion is not a sub\\xadset of the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion. The sys\\xadtem doesn’t evolve from a larger re\\xadgion to a smaller sub\\xadset (as in the Venn-di\\xada\\xadgram vi\\xadsu\\xadals in the OP), it just evolves from one set to an\\xadother.The first prob\\xadlem ex\\xadplic\\xaditly vi\\xado\\xadlates the OP’s defi\\xadni\\xadtion of an op\\xadti\\xadmizer, and the sec\\xadond prob\\xadlem vi\\xado\\xadlates one of the un\\xadspo\\xadken as\\xadsump\\xadtions pre\\xadsent in all of the OP’s ex\\xadam\\xadples.newstorkcity 24 Jun 2020 17:42 UTC 1 pointParentI don’t be\\xadlieve that ei\\xadther of these points are true. In your origi\\xadnal ex\\xadam\\xadple, there is one cor\\xadrect solu\\xadtion for any con\\xadvex func\\xadtion. I will as\\xadsume there is a sin\\xadgle hard-coded func\\xadtion for the fol\\xadlow\\xading, but it can be ex\\xadtended to work for an ar\\xadbi\\xadtrary func\\xadtion. The out\\xadput reg\\xadister hav\\xading the cor\\xadrect solu\\xadtion is the tar\\xadget set.The out\\xadput reg\\xadister hav\\xading any state is the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion.Clearly any spe\\xadcific num\\xadber (or rather sin\\xadgle\\xadton of that num\\xadber) is a sub\\xadset of all num\\xadbers, so the tar\\xadget is a sub\\xadset of the basin. And fur\\xadther, be\\xadcause “all num\\xadbers” has more than one el\\xade\\xadment, the tar\\xadget set is smaller than the basin.johnswentworth 24 Jun 2020 17:44 UTC 2 pointsParentThis ar\\xadgu\\xadment ap\\xadplies to liter\\xadally any de\\xadter\\xadminis\\xadtic pro\\xadgram with nonempty out\\xadput.

Like I said, not a par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlarly in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion but an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion none the less.To ex\\xadtend on this, the basin of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion is not any smaller than an iter\\xada\\xadtive pro\\xadcess act\\xading on a sin\\xadgle reg\\xadister (and if you loop the pro\\xadgram, then the time hori\\xadzon is the same). In both cases your basin is any\\xadthing in that reg\\xadister and the tar\\xadget state is one par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar num\\xadber in that reg\\xadister. As far as I can tell the defi\\xadni\\xadtion doesn’t have any way of say\\xading that one is “more of an op\\xadti\\xadmizer” than the other.

Two quick com\\xadments:It didn’t seem like you defined what it meant to evolve to\\xadwards the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. So it seems like ei\\xadther you need to com\\xadmit to the sys\\xadtem ac\\xadtu\\xadally reach\\xading one of the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions to call it an op\\xadti\\xadmiser, or you need some sort of met\\xadric over the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space to tell whether it’s get\\xadting closer to or fur\\xadther away from the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set. But if you’re rank\\xading all con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions any\\xadway, then I’m not sure it adds any\\xadthing to draw a bi\\xadnary dis\\xadtinc\\xadtion be\\xadtween tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions and all the oth\\xaders. In other words, can’t you keep the defi\\xadni\\xadtion in terms of a util\\xadity func\\xadtion, but just add per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions?Also, you don’t cite Den\\xadnett here, but his defi\\xadni\\xadtion has some im\\xadpor\\xadtant similar\\xadi\\xadties.

As an ex\\xadtreme ex\\xadam\\xadple, for any given sys\\xadtem, I can always aug\\xadment the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space with an ar\\xadbi\\xadtrary num\\xadber of dummy di\\xadmen\\xadsions, and choose the dy\\xadnam\\xadics such that these dummy di\\xadmen\\xadsions always get set to all zero af\\xadter each time step. Now, I can make the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion ar\\xadbi\\xadtrar\\xadily large, while the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set re\\xadmains a fixed size. This can then make any such dy\\xadnam\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem seem to be an ar\\xadbi\\xadtrar\\xadily pow\\xader\\xadful op\\xadti\\xadmiser.This could per\\xadhaps be solved by de\\xadmand\\xading the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space be se\\xadlected ac\\xadcord\\xading to Oc\\xadcam’s ra\\xadzor, but I think the out\\xadcome still ends up be\\xading prior de\\xadpen\\xaddent. It’d be nice for two ob\\xadservers who model op\\xadti\\xadmis\\xading sys\\xadtems in a sys\\xadtem\\xadat\\xadi\\xadcally differ\\xadent way to always agree within some con\\xadstant fac\\xadtor, akin to Kol\\xadmogorov com\\xadplex\\xadity’s in\\xadvar\\xadi\\xadance the\\xado\\xadrem, al\\xadthough this may well be im\\xadpos\\xadsi\\xadble.As a less face\\xadtious ex\\xadam\\xadple, con\\xadsider a com\\xadputer pro\\xadgram that re\\xadpeat\\xadedly sets a vari\\xadable to 0.

In or\\xadder to quan\\xadtify size of per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions in an in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading way, you need the pre-ex\\xadist\\xading con\\xadcept of which sub\\xadsys\\xadtems are do\\xading the op\\xadti\\xadmi\\xadsa\\xadtion.My preferred solu\\xadtion to this is just to stop try\\xading to define op\\xadti\\xadmi\\xadsa\\xadtion in terms of *out\\xadcomes*, and start defin\\xading it in terms of *com\\xadpu\\xadta\\xadtion* done by sys\\xadtems. E.g. a first at\\xadtempt might be: an agent is an op\\xadti\\xadmiser if it does plan\\xadning via ab\\xadstrac\\xadtion to\\xadwards some goal.

Other\\xadwise I could just say that the set of tar\\xadget states is all the di\\xadrec\\xadtions the sys\\xadtem might fly off in if you per\\xadturb it.So you might say that, for this ver\\xadsion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion to be mean\\xadingful, the set of tar\\xadget states has to be small (how\\xadever that’s quan\\xadtified), and for the util\\xadity max\\xadi\\xadmiza\\xadtion ver\\xadsion to be mean\\xadingful, you need the util\\xadity func\\xadtion to be sim\\xadple (how\\xadever that’s quan\\xadtified).EDIT: And ac\\xadtu\\xadally, maybe the two con\\xadcepts are sort of dual to each other. If you have an agent with a sim\\xadple util\\xadity func\\xadtion, then you could con\\xadsider all its lo\\xadcal op\\xadtima to be a (small) set of tar\\xadget states for an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem. And if you have an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem with a small set of tar\\xadget states, then you could eas\\xadily con\\xadvert that into a sim\\xadple util\\xadity func\\xadtion with a gra\\xaddi\\xadent to\\xadwards those states.And if your util\\xadity func\\xadtion isn’t sim\\xadple, maybe you wouldn’t get a small set of tar\\xadget states when you do the con\\xadver\\xadsion, and vice versa?Alex Flint 2 Jul 2020 1:54 UTC 4 pointsParentI’d say the util\\xadity func\\xadtion needs to con\\xadtain one or more lo\\xadcal op\\xadtima with large bas\\xadins of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion that con\\xadtain the ini\\xadtial state, not that the util\\xadity func\\xadtion needs to be sim\\xadple. The sim\\xadplest pos\\xadsi\\xadble util\\xadity func\\xadtion is a con\\xadstant func\\xadtion, which al\\xadlows the sys\\xadtem to wan\\xadder aim\\xadlessly and cer\\xadtainly not “cor\\xadrect” in any way for per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions.\\nESRogs 2 Jul 2020 5:01 UTC 2 pointsParentAh, good points!clwainwright 23 Jun 2020 0:22 UTC LW: 11 AF: 3AFThis seems like a good defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion for al\\xadgorith\\xadmic sys\\xadtems, but I don’t see how it works for phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems. Go\\xading by the pri\\xadmary defi\\xadni\\xadtion,An op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem is a sys\\xadtem that has a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards one of a set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions that we will call the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, when started from any con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion within a larger set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, which we call the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion.But in the phys\\xadi\\xadcal world, there are liter\\xadally zero closed sys\\xadtems with this prop\\xaderty. En\\xadtropy always in\\xadcreases*, and the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set will never be smaller than the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion. The dirt-plus-seed-plus-sun\\xadlight sys\\xadtem has a vastly smaller con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space than the dirt-plus-tree-plus-heat sys\\xadtem. Per\\xadhaps one could ob\\xadject that one should dis\\xadcount the in\\xadcom\\xading sun\\xadlight and out\\xadgo\\xading heat since the sys\\xadtem isn’t re\\xadally closed, but then con\\xadsider a very similar sys\\xadtem con\\xadsist\\xading of only dirt, air, and fun\\xadgal spores. Surely if a grow\\xading tree is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, then a grow\\xading mush\\xadroom in a closed sys\\xadtem is an op\\xadti\\xadmizer too. But the en\\xadtropy in\\xadcrease in the lat\\xadter case is un\\xadam\\xadbigu\\xadous: the num\\xadber of ways to ar\\xadrange atoms into a fully grown mush\\xadroom is again vastly larger than the num\\xadber of ways to con\\xadfigure atoms into dirt with\\xadout mush\\xadrooms but with the nu\\xadtri\\xadents to grow them.It may be pos\\xadsi\\xadble to get around this by re\\xaddefin\\xading con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion spaces that bet\\xadter match our in\\xadtu\\xadition (it does seem like a mush\\xadroom is more spe\\xadcial than dirt), but I don’t see any way to do this rigor\\xadously.*or, at least, en\\xadtropy always tends to in\\xadcrease.Thomas Kwa 26 Mar 2021 21:25 UTC 3 pointsParentI agree that closed phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtems aren’t op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems. It seems like the first patch given by the au\\xadthor works when worded more care\\xadfully: “We could stipu\\xadlate that some [low-en\\xadtropy] power source [and some en\\xadtropy sink] is pro\\xadvided ex\\xadter\\xadnally to each sys\\xadtem we an\\xada\\xadlyze, and then perform our anal\\xady\\xadsis con\\xaddi\\xadtional on the ex\\xadis\\xadtence of that power source.”\\nThen an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem with X bits of “op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion power” (which is log(tar\\xadget states /\\u200b basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion size) or some\\xadthing) has to sink at least X bits, and this seems like it works. Maybe it gets hard to rigor\\xadously define the ex\\xadact form of the power source and en\\xadtropy sink though?

One nat\\xadu\\xadral ap\\xadproach is to say that an op\\xadti\\xadmizer causes the world to have higher val\\xadues ac\\xadcord\\xading to some rea\\xadson\\xadable util\\xadity func\\xadtion, but this seems in\\xadsuffi\\xadcient, as then a <@bot\\xadtle cap would be an op\\xadti\\xadmizer@>(@Bot\\xadtle Caps Aren’t Op\\xadti\\xadmisers@) for keep\\xading wa\\xadter in the bot\\xadtle.This post pro\\xadvides a new defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, by tak\\xading a page from <@Embed\\xadded Agents@> and an\\xada\\xadlyz\\xading a sys\\xadtem as a whole in\\xadstead of sep\\xada\\xadrat\\xading the agent and en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment. An **op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem** is then one which tends to evolve to\\xadward some spe\\xadcial con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions (called the **tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set**), when start\\xading any\\xadwhere in some larger set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions (called the **basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion**), _even if_ the sys\\xadtem is per\\xadturbed.For ex\\xadam\\xadple, in gra\\xaddi\\xadent de\\xadscent, we start with some ini\\xadtial guess at the pa\\xadram\\xade\\xadters θ, and then con\\xadtinu\\xadally com\\xadpute loss gra\\xaddi\\xadents and move θ in the ap\\xadpro\\xadpri\\xadate di\\xadrec\\xadtion. The tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set is all the lo\\xadcal min\\xadima of the loss land\\xadscape. Such a pro\\xadgram has a very spe\\xadcial prop\\xaderty: while it is run\\xadning, you can change the value of θ (e.g. via a de\\xadbug\\xadger), and the pro\\xadgram will prob\\xada\\xadbly _still work_. This is quite im\\xadpres\\xadsive: cer\\xadtainly most pro\\xadgrams would not work if you ar\\xadbi\\xadtrar\\xadily changed the value of one of the vari\\xadables in the mid\\xaddle of ex\\xade\\xadcu\\xadtion. Thus, this is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem that is ro\\xadbust to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions in θ. Of course, it isn’t ro\\xadbust to ar\\xadbi\\xadtrary per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions: if you change any other vari\\xadable in the pro\\xadgram, it will prob\\xada\\xadbly stop work\\xading. In gen\\xaderal, we can quan\\xadtify how pow\\xader\\xadful an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem is by how ro\\xadbust it is to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions, and how small the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set is.The bot\\xadtle cap ex\\xadam\\xadple is _not_ an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem be\\xadcause there is no broad basin of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions from which we get to the bot\\xadtle be\\xading full of wa\\xadter. The bot\\xadtle cap doesn’t cause the bot\\xadtle to be full of wa\\xadter when it didn’t start out full of wa\\xadter.Op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtems are a su\\xadper\\xadset of goal-di\\xadrected agen\\xadtic sys\\xadtems, which re\\xadquire a sep\\xada\\xadra\\xadtion be\\xadtween the op\\xadti\\xadmizer and the thing be\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmized. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, a tree is cer\\xadtainly an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem (the tar\\xadget is to be a fully grown tree, and it is ro\\xadbust to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions of soil qual\\xadity, or if you cut off a branch, etc). How\\xadever, it does not seem to be a goal-di\\xadrected agen\\xadtic sys\\xadtem, as it would be hard to sep\\xada\\xadrate into an “op\\xadti\\xadmizer” and a “thing be\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmized”.This does mean that we can no longer ask “what is do\\xading the op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion” in an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem. This is a fea\\xadture, not a bug: if you ex\\xadpect to always be able to an\\xadswer this ques\\xadtion, you typ\\xadi\\xadcally get con\\xadfus\\xading re\\xadsults. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, you might say that your liver is op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for mak\\xading money, since with\\xadout it you would die and fail to make money.The full post has sev\\xaderal other ex\\xadam\\xadples that help make the con\\xadcept clearer.Planned opinion:I’ve <@pre\\xadvi\\xadously ar\\xadgued@>(@In\\xadtu\\xaditions about goal-di\\xadrected be\\xadhav\\xadior@) that we need to take gen\\xader\\xadal\\xadiza\\xadtion into ac\\xadcount in a defi\\xadni\\xadtion of op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion or goal-di\\xadrected be\\xadhav\\xadior. This defi\\xadni\\xadtion achieves that by pri\\xadmar\\xadily an\\xada\\xadlyz\\xading the ro\\xadbust\\xadness of the op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions. While this does rely on a no\\xadtion of coun\\xadter\\xadfac\\xadtu\\xadals, it still seems sig\\xadnifi\\xadcantly bet\\xadter than any pre\\xadvi\\xadous at\\xadtempt to ground op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion.I par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlarly like that the con\\xadcept doesn’t force us to have a sep\\xada\\xadrate agent and en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment, as that dis\\xadtinc\\xadtion does seem quite leaky upon close in\\xadspec\\xadtion. I gave a shot at ex\\xadplain\\xading sev\\xaderal other con\\xadcepts from AI al\\xadign\\xadment within this frame\\xadwork in this com\\xadment, and it worked quite well. In par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar, a com\\xadputer pro\\xadgram is a goal-di\\xadrected AI sys\\xadtem if there is an en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment such that adding the com\\xadputer pro\\xadgram to the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment trans\\xadforms it into a op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem for some “in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading” tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion states (with one caveat ex\\xadplained in the com\\xadment).Andrew_Critch 15 Dec 2020 1:06 UTC LW: 6 AF: 4AFThis post re\\xadminds me of think\\xading from 1950s when peo\\xadple tak\\xading in\\xadspira\\xadtion from Wiener’s work on cy\\xadber\\xadnet\\xadics tried to op\\xader\\xada\\xadtional\\xadize “pur\\xadpose\\xadful be\\xadhav\\xadior” in terms of ro\\xadbust con\\xadver\\xadgence to a goal state: https://\\u200b\\u200bheinon\\xadline.org/\\u200b\\u200bHOL/\\u200b\\u200bPage?col\\xadlec\\xadtion=jour\\xadnals&han\\xaddle=hein.jour\\xadnals/\\u200b\\u200bjosf29&id=48&men_tab=srchresults> When an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem de\\xadvi\\xadates be\\xadyond its own rim, we say that it dies.

Thank you.To what ex\\xadtent can we iden\\xadtify sub\\xadsets of the sys\\xadtem cor\\xadre\\xadspond\\xading to  “that which is be\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmized” and “that which is do\\xading the  op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion”?The in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion the\\xado\\xadretic mea\\xadsure of in\\xaddi\\xadvi\\xadd\\xadu\\xadal\\xadity at\\xadtempts to an\\xadswer ex\\xadactly this type of ques\\xadtion.From this view, a set of com\\xadpo\\xadnents (the sys\\xadtem) is de\\xadcom\\xadposed into two sub\\xadsets (sub\\xadsys\\xadtem + en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment). The pro\\xadposed sub\\xadsys\\xadtem is as\\xadsigned a de\\xadgree of in\\xaddi\\xadvi\\xadd\\xadu\\xadal\\xadity by mea\\xadsur\\xading the amount of in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion it shares with its fu\\xadture state, op\\xadtion\\xadally con\\xaddi\\xadtioned on its en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment. This leads to 2 types of in\\xaddi\\xadvi\\xadd\\xadu\\xadal\\xadity. The first type says that a pro\\xadposed sub\\xadsys\\xadtem is in\\xaddi\\xadvi\\xadd\\xadu\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic to the de\\xadgree that the sub\\xadsys\\xadtem is pre\\xaddic\\xadtive of its fu\\xadture state af\\xadter ac\\xadcount\\xading for the in\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion in the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment. The sec\\xadond type cap\\xadtures the no\\xadtion of in\\xadsep\\xada\\xadra\\xadbil\\xadity by as\\xadsign\\xading a high de\\xadgree of in\\xaddi\\xadvi\\xadd\\xadu\\xadal\\xadity to sub\\xadsys\\xadtems that are strongly cou\\xadpled with their en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment in such a way that nei\\xadther the sub\\xadsys\\xadtem nor en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment alone are pre\\xaddic\\xadtive of the next state of the sub\\xadsys\\xadtem.For ex\\xadam\\xadple, con\\xadsid\\xader\\xading the set of atoms mak\\xading up the space con\\xadtain\\xading the robot-op\\xadti\\xadmizer and vase, the set of robot-atoms re\\xadtains the de\\xadsired prop\\xader\\xadties of an op\\xadti\\xadmizer, and is also highly in\\xaddi\\xadvi\\xadd\\xadu\\xadal\\xadis\\xadtic in the first sense since know\\xading the state of the robot atoms tells you a lot about their next state, but know\\xading about the set of non-robot atoms tells you very lit\\xadtle about the state of the robot. On the other hand, con\\xadsid\\xader\\xading the set of atoms mak\\xading up the tree, the sys\\xadtem as a whole is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, but no in\\xaddi\\xadvi\\xadd\\xadual sub\\xadset of atoms ac\\xadcom\\xadplishes the tar\\xadget of the larger op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem.Alex Flint 27 Jun 2020 18:50 UTC LW: 2 AF: 1AFParentThank you for the poin\\xadter to this ter\\xadminol\\xadogy. It seems rele\\xadvant and I wasn’t aware of the ter\\xadminol\\xadogy be\\xadfore.\\nVivek Hebbar 8 Sep 2021 0:23 UTC LW: 2 AF: 2AFIs a metal bar an op\\xadti\\xadmizer? Look\\xading at the tem\\xadper\\xada\\xadture dis\\xadtri\\xadbu\\xadtion, there is a clear set of tar\\xadget states (states of uniform tem\\xadper\\xada\\xadture) with a much larger basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion (all tem\\xadper\\xada\\xadture dis\\xadtri\\xadbu\\xadtions that don’t va\\xadpor\\xadize the bar).I sup\\xadpose we could con\\xadsider the sec\\xadond law of ther\\xadmo\\xaddy\\xadnam\\xadics to be the true op\\xadti\\xadmizer in this case. The con\\xadse\\xadquence is that any* closed phys\\xadi\\xadcal sys\\xadtem is triv\\xadially an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem to\\xadwards higher en\\xadtropy.In gen\\xaderal, it seems like this op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion crite\\xadrion is very easy to satisfy if we don’t spec\\xadify what ex\\xadactly we care about as a mean\\xadingful as\\xadpect of the sys\\xadtem. Even the bot\\xadtle cap ‘op\\xadti\\xadmizes’ for triv\\xadial things like main\\xadtain\\xading its shape (against the per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion of elas\\xadtic de\\xadfor\\xadma\\xadtion).  Do you think this will be\\xadcome a prob\\xadlem when us\\xading this defi\\xadni\\xadtion for AI? For ex\\xadam\\xadple, we might find that a par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar pro\\xadgram in\\xadci\\xadden\\xadtally tends to ‘op\\xadti\\xadmize’ cer\\xadtain sim\\xadple mea\\xadsures such as the av\\xader\\xadage mag\\xadni\\xadtude of net\\xadwork weights, or some other func\\xadtions of weights, loss, policy, etc. to a set point/\\u200brange. We may then find slightly more com\\xadplex things be\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmized that look like sub-goals (which could in a cer\\xadtain con\\xadtext be un\\xadwanted or dan\\xadger\\xadous).  How would we know where to draw the line? It seems like the defi\\xadni\\xadtion would clas\\xadsify lots of things as op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion, and it would be up to us to de\\xadcide which kinds are in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading or con\\xadcern\\xading and which ones are as triv\\xadial as the bot\\xadtle cap main\\xadtain\\xading its shape.That be\\xading said, I re\\xadally like this defi\\xadni\\xadtion. I just think it should be ex\\xadtended to clas\\xadsify the in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading\\xadness of a given op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion. An AI agent which com\\xadpe\\xadtently pur\\xadsues com\\xadplex goals is a much more in\\xadter\\xadest\\xading op\\xadti\\xadmizer than a metal bar, even though the bar seems more ro\\xadbust (delet\\xading a tiny piece of metal won’t stop it from con\\xadduct\\xading; delet\\xading a tiny piece in the AI’s com\\xadputer could to\\xadtally dis\\xadable it).Also a nit\\xadpick on the sec\\xadtion about whether the uni\\xadverse is an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem:I don’t think it is cor\\xadrect to say that the tar\\xadget space is al\\xadmost as big as the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion. Either:We use area to rep\\xadre\\xadsent the num\\xadber of macro\\xadscopic states—in this case, the tar\\xadget space is ex\\xadtremely small (one state only(?) -- an ul\\xadtra-low-den\\xadsity bath of par\\xadti\\xadcles with uniform tem\\xadper\\xada\\xadture).  The uni\\xadverse is an ex\\xadtremely pow\\xader\\xadful op\\xadti\\xadmizer from this per\\xadspec\\xadtive, with the caveat that it takes al\\xadmost for\\xadever to achieve its tar\\xadget.We use area to rep\\xadre\\xadsent the num\\xadber of micro\\xadscopic states (as I think you in\\xadtended).  In this case, I think the tar\\xadget space is ex\\xadactly iden\\xadti\\xadcal to the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion. Low en\\xadtropy microstates are not any less likely than high en\\xadtropy microstates—there just hap\\xadpen to be as\\xadtro\\xadnom\\xadi\\xadcally fewer of them. There is no ‘op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading force’ push\\xading the uni\\xadverse out of these states. From the microstate per\\xadspec\\xadtive, there is no rea\\xadson to ex\\xadclude them from the tar\\xadget zone, since any small and un\\xadre\\xadmark\\xadable sub\\xadset of the tar\\xadget space will dis\\xadplay the prop\\xaderty that the sys\\xadtem tends to stum\\xadble out of it at ran\\xaddom.I would say that the first lens is al\\xadmost always bet\\xadter than the sec\\xadond, since macro-states are what we ac\\xadtu\\xadally care about and how we nat\\xadu\\xadrally di\\xadvide the con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion space of a sys\\xadtem.Fi\\xadnally, just want to say this is an amaz\\xading post!

On the other hand, mak\\xading its heat\\xading el\\xade\\xadment more pow\\xader\\xadful wouldn’t af\\xadfect the fi\\xadnal tem\\xadper\\xada\\xadture.\\nI won\\xadder if this sug\\xadgests that an agent’s goal lives in the last place in a causal chain of things you can per\\xadturb to change the set of tar\\xadget states of the sys\\xadtem.Chantiel 15 Aug 2021 19:55 UTC 1 pointAFYou said your defi\\xadni\\xadtion would not clas\\xadsify a bot\\xadtle cap with wa\\xadter in it as an op\\xadti\\xadmizer. This might be re\\xadally nit-picky, but I’m not sure it’s gen\\xader\\xadally true.\\nI say this be\\xadcause the wa\\xadter in the bot\\xadtle cap could evap\\xado\\xadrate. Thus, sup\\xadpos\\xading there is no rain, from a wide range of pos\\xadsi\\xadble states of the bot\\xadtle cap, it would tend to\\xadwards no longer hav\\xading wa\\xadter in it.\\nI know you said you make an ex\\xadcep\\xadtion for ten\\xadden\\xadcies to\\xadwards in\\xadcreased en\\xadtropy be\\xading con\\xadsid\\xadered op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xaders. How\\xadever, this does not in\\xadcrease the en\\xadtropy of the bot\\xadtle\\xadcap, It could po\\xadten\\xadtially in\\xadcrease the en\\xadtropy of the wa\\xadter that was in the bot\\xadtle cap, but this is not nec\\xades\\xadsar\\xadily the case. For ex\\xadam\\xadple, if the bot\\xadtle cap is kept in a sealed con\\xadtainer, the wa\\xadter va\\xadpor could po\\xadten\\xadtially con\\xaddense into a small pud\\xaddle with the same en\\xadtropy as it had in the bot\\xadtle cap.\\nIf my mem\\xadory of physics is cor\\xadrect, wa\\xadter evap\\xado\\xadrat\\xading would still in\\xadcreases the to\\xadtal en\\xadtropy of the to\\xadtal sys\\xadtem in which the bot\\xadtle cap is lo\\xadcated, by virtue of re\\xadleas\\xading some heat into the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment . How\\xadever, note that hu\\xadmans and robots also, merely by do\\xading me\\xadchan\\xadi\\xadcal work and thus form\\xading heat which is then dis\\xadpersed into the en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment, re\\xadsult in in\\xadcreased en\\xadtropy of the sys\\xadtem they’re in. So you can’t rule out any sys\\xadtem that makes its en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadment tend to\\xadwards in\\xadcreased en\\xadtropy from be\\xading an op\\xadti\\xadmizer, be\\xadcause that’s what hu\\xadmans and robots do, too.\\nThat said, if you clar\\xadify that the bot\\xadtle cap is not in any such con\\xadtained sys\\xadtem, I think the wa\\xadter would re\\xadsult in a higher-en\\xadtropy state.Alex Flint 16 Aug 2021 17:17 UTC LW: 2 AF: 1AFParentThank you for this com\\xadment Chantiel. Yes, a con\\xadtainer that en\\xadg\\xadineered to evap\\xado\\xadrate wa\\xadter poured any\\xadwhere into it and con\\xaddense it into a cen\\xadtral area would be an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem by my defi\\xadni\\xadtion. That is a bit like a ball rol\\xadling down a hill, which is also an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem and also has noth\\xading re\\xadsem\\xadbling agency. I am\\nThe bot\\xadtle cap ex\\xadam\\xadple was ac\\xadtu\\xadally about putting a bot\\xadtle cap onto a bot\\xadtle and ask\\xading whether, since the wa\\xadter now stays in\\xadside the bot\\xadtle, it should be con\\xadsid\\xadered an op\\xadti\\xadmizer. I pointed out that this would not qual\\xadify as an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem be\\xadcause if you moved a wa\\xadter molecule from the bot\\xadtle and place it out\\xadside the bot\\xadtle, the bot\\xadtle cap would not act to put it back in\\xadside.Chantiel 14 May 2021 23:17 UTC 1 pointAn op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem is a sys\\xadtem that has a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards one of a set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions that we will call the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set, when started from any con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion within a larger set of con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions, which we call the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, and con\\xadtinues to ex\\xadhibit this ten\\xaddency with re\\xadspect to the same tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion set de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions.If I’m rea\\xadson\\xading cor\\xadrectly, I think this defi\\xadni\\xadtion could clas\\xadsify just about any\\xadthing as an op\\xadti\\xadmizer.Con\\xadsider inan\\xadi\\xadmate biolog\\xadi\\xadcal sub\\xadstances, like a leaf.

Is this an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem?In or\\xadder to qual\\xadify as an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, a sys\\xadtem must (1) have a ten\\xaddency to evolve to\\xadwards a set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions that are small rel\\xada\\xadtive to the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion, and (2) con\\xadtinue to evolve to\\xadwards the same set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions if per\\xadturbed.If we reach in while the billiard balls are bounc\\xading around and move one of the balls that is in mo\\xadtion, the sys\\xadtem will now come to rest in a differ\\xadent con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion. There\\xadfore this is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, be\\xadcause there is no set of tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtions to\\xadwards which the sys\\xadtem evolves de\\xadspite per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions. A sys\\xadtem does not need to be ro\\xadbust along all di\\xadmen\\xadsions in or\\xadder to be an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem, but a billiard table ex\\xadhibits no such ro\\xadbust di\\xadmen\\xadsions at all, so it is not an op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading sys\\xadtem.What about tak\\xading the tar\\xadget con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion to be any state in which all the billiard balls are sta\\xadtion\\xadary? A wide range of states of billiards bounc\\xading around on a table would re\\xadsult in all the balls end\\xading up sta\\xadtion\\xadary, so I don’t see how it wouldn’t be clas\\xadsified as an op\\xadti\\xadmiza\\xadtion pro\\xadcess.Also, I’ve made my own at\\xadtempt at defin\\xading “op\\xadti\\xadmizer” here, in case you’re in\\xadter\\xadested.Alex Flint 15 May 2021 16:07 UTC 2 pointsParentThank you for this com\\xadment Chantiel.\\n\\nCon\\xadsider inan\\xadi\\xadmate biolog\\xadi\\xadcal sub\\xadstances, like a leaf.

But I’m con\\xadcerned that a defi\\xadni\\xadtion that in\\xadclude leaves, knives, billiard balls, and rocket ships is overly broad.More gen\\xader\\xadally, it seems like this defi\\xadni\\xadtion clas\\xadsifies a lot of things that change in some way over time as an op\\xadti\\xadmizer. In gen\\xaderal, if some\\xadthing tends to be differ\\xadent in some ways when it’s young than old, then I think you can say the sys\\xadtem is an op\\xadti\\xadmizer op\\xadti\\xadmiz\\xading for what\\xadever char\\xadac\\xadter\\xadis\\xadtics cor\\xadre\\xadlate with old\\xadness.

I don’t think this buys you much, and seems to need\\xadlessly rule out goals based on nar\\xadrow main\\xadte\\xadnance of some sta\\xadtus-quo. Switch\\xading to a util\\xadity func\\xadtion as sug\\xadgested by oth\\xaders im\\xadproves things, I think.For ex\\xadam\\xadple: a highly ca\\xadpa\\xadble AI whose only goal is to main\\xadtain a chess set in a par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar po\\xadsi\\xadtion for as long as pos\\xadsi\\xadble, but not to care about it af\\xadter it’s dis\\xadturbed.Here the tar\\xadget set is iden\\xadti\\xadcal to the basin of at\\xadtrac\\xadtion: states con\\xadtain\\xading the chess set in the par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar po\\xadsi\\xadtion (or his\\xadto\\xadries where it’s re\\xadmained undis\\xadturbed).This doesn’t tell us any\\xadthing about what the AI will do in pur\\xadsu\\xading this goal. It may not do much un\\xadtil some\\xadthing ap\\xadproaches the board; it may re-ar\\xadrange the galaxy to min\\xadimise the chances that a piece will be moved (but ar\\xadbi\\xadtrar\\xadily small en\\xadvi\\xadron\\xadmen\\xadtal changes might have it take very differ\\xadent ac\\xadtions, so in gen\\xaderal we can’t say it’s op\\xadti\\xadmis\\xading for some par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlar con\\xadfigu\\xadra\\xadtion of the galaxy).I want to say that this sys\\xadtem is op\\xadti\\xadmis\\xading to keep the chess set undis\\xadturbed.With util\\xadity you can eas\\xadily rep\\xadre\\xadsent this goal, and all you need to do is com\\xadpare un\\xadper\\xadturbed util\\xadity with the util\\xadity un\\xadder var\\xadi\\xadous per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtions.Some\\xadthing like: The sys\\xadtem S op\\xadti\\xadmises U 𝛿-ro\\xadbustly to per\\xadtur\\xadba\\xadtion x if E[U(S)] - E[U(x(S))] < 𝛿Back to top\",\n",

Gordon Tullock originated the idea in 1967, and Anne Krueger introduced the label in 1974. The idea is simple but powerful. People are said to seek rents when they try to obtain benefits for themselves through the political arena. They typically do so by getting a subsidy for a good they produce or for being in a particular class of people, by getting a tariff on a good they produce, or by getting a special regulation that hampers their competitors. Elderly people, for example, often seek higher Social Security payments; steel producers often seek restrictions on imports of steel; and licensed electricians and doctors often lobby to keep regulations in place that restrict competition from unlicensed electricians or doctors.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut why do economists use the term “rent”? Unfortunately, there is no good reason. David Ricardo introduced the term “rent” in economics. It means the payment to a factor of production in excess of what is required to keep that factor in its present use. So, for example, if I am paid $150,000 in my current job but I would stay in that job for any salary over $130,000, I am making $20,000 in rent. What is wrong with rent seeking? Absolutely nothing. I would be rent seeking if I asked for a raise. My employer would then be free to decide if my services are worth it. Even though I am seeking rents by asking for a raise, this is not what economists mean by “rent seeking.” They use the term to describe people’s lobbying of government to give them special privileges. A much better term is “privilege seeking.”\\n\\n\\nIt has been known for centuries that people lobby the government for privileges. Tullock’s insight was that expenditures on lobbying for privileges are costly and that these expenditures, therefore, dissipate some of the gains to the beneficiaries and cause inefficiency. If, for example, a steel firm spends one million dollars lobbying and advertising for restrictions on steel imports, whatever money it gains by succeeding, presumably more than one million, is not a net gain. From this gain must be subtracted the one-million-dollar cost of seeking the restrictions. Although such an expenditure is rational from the narrow viewpoint of the firm that spends it, it represents a use of real resources to get a transfer from others and is therefore a pure loss to the economy as a whole.\\n\\n\\nKrueger (1974) independently discovered the idea in her study of poor economies whose governments heavily regulated their people’s economic lives. She pointed out that the regulation was so extensive that the government had the power to create “rents” equal to a large percentage of national income. For India in 1964, for example, Krueger estimated that government regulation created rents equal to 7.3 percent of national income; for Turkey in 1968, she estimated that rents from import licenses alone were about 15 percent of Turkey’s gross national product. Krueger did not attempt to estimate what percentage of these rents were dissipated in the attempt to get them. Tullock (1993) tentatively maintained that expenditures on rent-seeking in democracies are not very large.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n\\nDavid R. Henderson is the editor of this encyclopedia.
